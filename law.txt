poison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to 
him. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is 
caused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate.

intending  to  cause  Z's  death,  knowingly  co-operate  in  causing  that  effect  by  illegally  omitting,  each  during  the  time  of  his 
attendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of

amounting  to  murder.  B,  having  ill-will  towards  Z  and  intending  to  kill  him,  and  not  having  been  subject  to  the  provocation, 
assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z's death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of 
culpable homicide.

67.  Imprisonment  for  non-payment  of  fine,  when  offence  punishable  with  fine  only.—If  the 
offence be punishable with fine only, 1[the imprisonment which the Court imposes in default of payment 
of  the  fine  shall  be  simple,  and]  the  term  for  which  the  Court  directs the  offender  to  be  imprisoned,  in 
default of payment of fine, shall not exceed the following scale, that is to say, for any term not exceeding 
two  months  when  the  amount  of  the  fine  shall  not  exceed  fifty  rupees,  and  for any  term  not  exceeding 
four months when the amount shall not exceed one hundred rupees, and for any term not exceeding six 
months in any other case. 

68.  Imprisonment  to  terminate  on  payment  of  fine.—The  imprisonment  which  is  imposed  in 

default of payment of a fine shall terminate whenever that fine is either paid or levied by process of law. 

69.  Termination  of  imprisonment  on  payment  of  proportional  part  of  fine.—If,  before  the 
expiration of the term of imprisonment fixed in default of payment, such a proportion of the fine be paid 
or levied that the term of imprisonment suffered in default of payment is not less than proportional to the 
part of the fine still unpaid, the imprisonment shall terminate. 

Illustration 

A is sentenced to a fine of one hundred rupees and to four months' imprisonment in default of payment. Here, if seventy-five 
rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the 
first  month has expired. If seventy-five rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of the first  month, or at any later 
time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be immediately discharged. If fifty rupees of the fine be paid or levied before the 
expiration of two months of the imprisonment. A will be discharged as soon as the two months are completed. If fifty rupees be 
paid or levied at the time of the expiration of those two months, or at any later time while A continues in imprisonment, A will be 
immediately discharged. 

70.  Fine  leviable  within  six  years,  of  during  imprisonment.  Death  not  to  discharge  property 
from liability.—The fine, or any part thereof which remains unpaid, may be levied at any time within six 
years after the passing of the sentence, and if, under the sentence, the offender be liable to imprisonment 
for a longer period than six years, then at any time previous to the expiration of that period; and the death 
of the offender does not discharge from the liability any property which would, after his death, be legally 
liable for his debts. 

71.  Limit  of  punishment  of  offence  made  up  of  several  offences.—Where  anything  which  is  an 
offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with 
the punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided. 

2[Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for 

the time being by which offences are defined or punished, or 

where  several  acts,  of  which  one  or  more  than  one  would  by  itself  or  themselves  constitute  an 

offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence, 

the  offender  shall  not  be  punished  with  a  more  severe  punishment  than  the  Court  which  tries  him 

could award for any one of such offences]. 

Illustrations 

(a)  A  gives  Z  fifty  strokes  with  a  stick.  Here  A  may  have  committed  the  offence  of  voluntarily  causing  hurt  to  Z  by  the 
whole beating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, 
he might be imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating. 

(b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to Y is no part of the act 
whereby  A  voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the 
blow given to Y. 

72.  Punishment  of  person  guilty  of  one  of  several  offences,  the  judgment  stating  that  it  is 
doubtful  of  which.—In  all  cases  in  which  judgment  is  given  that  a  person  is  guilty  of  one  of  several 
offences  specified  in  the  judgment,  but  that  it  is  doubtful  of  which  of  these  offences  he  is  guilty,  the 
offender  shall  be  punished  for  the  offence  for  which  the  lowest  punishment  is  provided  if  the  same 
punishment is not provided for all.

73.  Solitary  confinement.—Whenever  any  person  is  convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  under  this 
Code  the  Court  has  power  to  sentence  him  to  rigorous  imprisonment,  the  Court  may,  by  its  sentence, 
order  that  the  offender  shall  be  kept  in  solitary  confinement  for  any  portion  or  portions  of  the 
imprisonment  to  which  he  is  sentenced,  not  exceeding  three  months  in  the  whole,  according  to  the 
following scale, that is to say— 

a time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months; 

a time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months and1[shall not 

exceed one] year 

a time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year. 

74.  Limit  of  solitary  confinement.—In  executing  a  sentence  of  solitary  confinement,  such 
confinement shall in no case exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary 
confinement  of  not  less  duration  than  such  periods;  and  when  the  imprisonment  awarded  shall  exceed 
three  months,  the  solitary  confinement  shall  not  exceed  seven  days  in  any  one  month  of  the  whole 
imprisonment  awarded,  with  intervals  between  the  periods  of  solitary  confinement  of  not  less  duration 
than such periods.

previous conviction.—Whoever, having been convicted,— 

(a)  by  a  Court  in  3[India],  of  an  offence  punishable  under  Chapter  XII  or  Chapter  XVII  of  this 

Code with imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards, 4***

CHAPTER IV 

GENERAL EXCEPTIONS 

Illustrations 

76.  Act  done  by  a  person  bound,  or  by  mistake  of  fact  believing  himself  bound,  by  law.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by 
reason of a mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it. 

(a)  A,  a  soldier,  fires  on  a  mob  by  the  order  of  his  superior  officer,  in  conformity  with  the  commands  of  the  law.  A  has 

committed no offence. 

arrests Z. A has committed no offence. 

(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, 

77.  Act  of  Judge  when  acting  judicially.—Nothing  is  an  offence  which  is  done  by  a  Judge  when 
acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to 
him by law. 

78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.—Nothing which is done in pursuance 
of, or which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice; if done whilst such judgment or 
order remains in force, is an offence, notwithstanding the Court may have had no jurisdiction to pass such 
judgment  or  order,  provided  the  person  doing  the  act  in  good  faith  believes  that  the  Court  had  such 
jurisdiction. 

                                                           
1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”. 
2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75. 
3. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A. O. 1948, the A. O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., 

to read as above. 

4. The word “or” omitted by Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch. 
5. Cl. (b) omitted by s. 3 and the Sch., ibid. 
6. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). 

 

25 

79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake 
of  fact  and  not  by  reason  of  a  mistake  of  law  in  good  faith,  believes  himself  to  be  justified  by  law,  in 
doing it. 

A sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of 
the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper 
authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. 

80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, 
and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful 
means and with proper care and caution. 

Illustration 

Illustration 

A  is  at  work  with  a  hatchet;  the  head  flies  off  and  kills  a  man  who  is  standing  by.  Here,  if  there  was  no  want  of  proper 

caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. 

81.  Act  likely  to  cause  harm,  but  done  without  criminal  intent,  and  to  prevent  other  harm.—
Nothing  is  an  offence  merely  by  reason  of  its  being  done  with  the  knowledge  that  it  is  likely  to  cause 
harm,  if  it  be  done  without  any  criminal  intention  to  cause  harm,  and  in  good  faith  for  the  purpose  of 
preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property. 

Explanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was 
of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that 
it was likely to cause harm. 

Illustrations 

(a)  A,  the  captain  of  a  steam  vessel,  suddenly,  and  without  any  fault  or  negligence  on  his  part,  finds  himself  in  such  a 
position  that,  before  he  can  stop  his  vessel,  he  must  inevitably  run  down  a  boat  B,  with  twenty  or  thirty  passengers  on  board, 
unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with 
only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the 
boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, 
though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of 
fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. 

(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention 
in  good  faith  of  saving  human  life  or  property.  Here,  if  it  be  found that the harm  to  be prevented  was  of  such  a  nature  and  so 
imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence. 

82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under 

seven years of age.  

83.  Act  of  a  child  above  seven  and  under  twelve  of  immature  understanding.—Nothing  is  an 
offence  which  is  done  by  a  child  above  seven  years  of  age  and  under  twelve,  who  has  not  attained 
sufficient  maturity  of  understanding  to  judge  of  the  nature  and  consequences  of  his  conduct  on  that 
occasion. 

84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the 
time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that 
he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. 

85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—
Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, 
incapable  of  knowing  the  nature  of  the  act,  or  that  he  is  doing  what  is  either  wrong,  or  contrary  to  
law:  provided  that  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was  administered  to  him  without  his  knowledge  or 
against his will. 

86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—
In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person 
who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge 
as  he  would  have  had  if  he  had  not  been  intoxicated,  unless  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was 
administered to him without his knowledge or against his will. 

 

26 

87.  Act  not  intended  and  not  known  to  be  likely  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt,  done  by 
consent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the 
doer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, 
or be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, 
whether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the 
doer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. 

A  and  Z  agree  to  fence  with  each  other  for  amusement.  This  agreement  implies  the  consent  of  each  to  suffer  any  harm 
which,  in  the  course  of  such  fencing,  may  be  caused  without  foul  play;  and  if  A,  while  playing  fairly,  hurts  Z,  A  commits  no 
offence. 

88.  Act  not  intended  to  cause  death,  done  by  consent  in  good  faith  for  person's  benefit.—
Nothing, which is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or 
be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose 
benefit it is done in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that 
harm, or to take the risk of that harm. 

Illustration 

Illustration 

A, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, 
but not intending to cause Z's death, and intending, in good faith, Z's benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z's consent. A 
has committed no offence. 

89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—
Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound 
mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of 
that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause 
or be known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— 

Provisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the 

attempting to cause death; 

Secondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing 
it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous 
hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; 

Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the 
attempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or 
the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; 

Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing 

of which offence it would not extend. 

Illustration 

A, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to 
be likely that the operation will  cause the child's death, but not intending to cause the child's death. A is  within the exception,  
inasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. 

90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as 
is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a 
misconception  of  fact,  and  if  the  person doing the act  knows,  or  has reason  to believe,  that  the consent 
was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or 

Consent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or 

intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or 

Consent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person 

who is under twelve years of age. 

91.  Exclusion  of  acts  which  are  offences  independently  of  harm  cause.—The  exceptions  in 
sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they 
may cause, or be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or 
on whose behalf the consent is given. 

 

27 

Illustration 

Causing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently 
of any harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence  “by reason of such harm”; 
and the consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. 

92.  Act  done  in  good  faith  for  benefit  of  a  person  without  consent.—Nothing  is  an  offence  by 
reason of any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without 
that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, 
or if that person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of 
him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— 

Provisos.  First.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  intentional  causing  of  death,  or  the 

attempting to cause death; 

Secondly.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  doing  of  anything  which  the  person  doing  it 
knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or 
the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; 

Thirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to 

cause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; 

Fourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of 

which offence it would not extend. 

Illustrations 

(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z's 
death, but in good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed 
no offence. 

(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, 

and in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. 

(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. 
There is not time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in 
good faith, the child's benefit. A has committed no offence. 

(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the housestop, 
knowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith,  the child's 
benefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. 

Explanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. 

93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by 

reason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. 

Illustration 

A, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the 

shock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient's death. 

94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State 
punishable  with  death,  nothing  is  an  offence  which  is  done  by  a  person  who  is  compelled  to  do  it  by 
threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person 
will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a 
reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which 
he became subject to such constraint. 

Explanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a 
gang of dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of 
his having been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. 

Explanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a 
thing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of 
a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. 

 

28 

95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to 
cause,  or  that  it  is  known  to  be  likely  to  cause,  any  harm,  if  that  harm  is  so  slight  that  no  person  of 
ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. 

Of the Right of Private Defence 

96.  Things  done  in  private  defence.—Nothing  is  an  offence  which  is  done  in  the  exercise  of  the 

right of private defence. 

97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the 

restrictions contained in section 99, to defend— 

First.—His  own  body,  and  the  body  of  any  other  person,  against  any  offence  affecting  the  human 

body; 

Secondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against 
any act which is an offence falling under the defintion of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or 
which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. 

98.  Right  of  private  defence  against  the  act  of  a  person  of  unsound  mind,  etc.—When  an  act, 
which  would  otherwise  be  a  certain  offence,  is  not  that  offence,  by  reason  of  the  youth,  the  want  of 
maturity of understanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by 
reason of any misconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence 
against that act which he would have if the act were that offence. 

Illustrations 

(a)  Z,  under  the  influence  of  madness,  attempts  to  kill  A;  Z  is  guilty  of  no  offence.  But  A  has  the  same  right  of  private 

defence which he would have if Z were sane. 

(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. 
Here  Z,  by  attacking  A  under  this  misconception,  commits  no  offence.  But  A  has  the  same  right  of  private  defence  against  Z, 
which he would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. 

99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence 
against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or 
attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, 
may not be strictly justifiable by law. 

There is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension 
of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in 
good faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. 

There is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of 

the public authorities. 

Extent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the 

inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. 

Explanation  1.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or 
attempted  to  be  done,  by  a  public  servant,  as  such,  unless  he  knows  or  has  reason  to  believe,  that  the 
person doing the act is such public servant. 

Explanation  2.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or 
attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that 
the person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which 
he acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. 

100.  When  the  right  of  private  defence  of  the  body  extends  to  causing  death.—The  right  of 
private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the 
voluntary  causing  of  death  or  of  any  other  harm  to  the  assailant,  if  the  offence  which  occasions  the 
exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:— 

First.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  death  will  otherwise  be  the 

consequence of such assault; 

 

29 

Secondly.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  grievous  hurt  will 

otherwise be the consequence of such assault; 

Thirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; 

Fourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; 

Fifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting; 

Sixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which 
may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities 
for his release. 

1[Seventhly.—An  act  of  throwing  or  administering  acid  or  an  attempt  to  throw  or  administer  acid 
which  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  grievous  hurt  will  otherwise  be  the  consequence  of 
such act.] 

101. When such  right  extends  to causing  any  harm  other  than  death.—If  the  offence  be  not  of 
any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body 
does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions 
mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. 

102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of 
private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises 
from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it 
continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. 

103.  When  the  right  of  private  defence  of  property  extends  to  causing  death.—The  right  of 
private  defence  of  property  extends,  under  the  restrictions  mentioned  in  section  99,  to  the  voluntary 
causing of death or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the 
attempting to commit which, occasions the exercise of the right, be an offence of any of the descriptions 
hereinafter enumerated, namely:— 

First.—Robbery; 

Secondly.—House-breaking by night; 

Thirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is 

used as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; 

Fourthly.—Theft,  mischief,  or  house-trespass,  under  such  circumstances  as  may  reasonably  cause 
apprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not 
exercised. 

104.  When  such  right  extends  to  causing  any  harm  other  than  death.—If  the  offence,  the 
committing  of  which,  or  the  attempting  to  commit  which  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  private 
defence,  be  theft,  mischief,  or  criminal  trespass,  not  of  any  of  the  descriptions  enumerated  in  the  last 
preceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to 
the  restrictions  mentioned  in  section  99,  to  the  voluntary  causing  to  the  wrong-doer  of  any  harm  other 
than death. 

105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of 
private  defence  of  property  commences  when  a  reasonable  apprehension  of  danger  to  the  property 
commences. 

The right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat 
with  the  property  or  either  the  assistance  of  the  public  authorities  is  obtained,  or  the  property  has  been 
recovered. 

The right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or 
attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or 
of instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues. 

The right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the 

offender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief.

30 

The  right  of  private  defence  of  property  against  house-breaking  by  night  continues  as  long  as  the 

house-trespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues. 

106.  Right  of  private  defence  against  deadly  assault  when  there  is  risk  of  harm  to  innocent 
person.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the 
apprehension of  death, the  defender  be  so situated that  he  cannot  effectually  exercise that right  without 
risk of harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. 

A is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing 
on the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if 
by so firing he harms any of the children.

CHAPTER V 

OF ABETMENT 

107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— 

First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or 

Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that 
thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of 
that thing; or 

Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. 

Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material 
fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing 
to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. 

Illustration 

A, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is 
not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally  causes  A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the 
apprehension of C. 

Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in 
order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid 
the doing of that act. 

108.  Abettor.—A  person  abets  an  offence,  who  abets  either  the  commission  of  an  offence,  or  the 
commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing 
an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. 

Explanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to  an offence although 

the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. 

Explanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should 

be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. 

(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. 

(b)  A  instigates  B  to  murder  D.  B  in  pursuance  of  the  instigation  stabs  D.  D  recovers  from  the  wound.  A  is  guilty  of 

instigating B to commit murder. 

Explanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an 
offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty 
intention or knowledge.

Illustrations 

(a)  A,  with  a  guilty  intention,  abets  a  child  or  a  lunatic  to  commit  an  act  which  would  be  an  offence,  if  committed  by  a 
person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or 
not, is guilty of abetting an offence. 

(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. 
B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable 
by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an 
offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. 

(c)  A  instigates  B  to  set  fire  to  a  dwelling-house.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  unsoundness  of  his  mind,  being  incapable  of 
knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's 
instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to 
the punishment provided for that offence. 

(d)  A,  intending  to  cause  a  theft  to  be  committed,  instigates  B  to  take  property  belonging  to  Z  out  of  Z's  possession.  A 
induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's 
property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of 
abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. 

Explanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such  an abetment is 

also an offence. 

A  instigates  B  to  instigate  C  to  murder  Z.  B  accordingly  instigates  C  to  murder  Z,  and  C  commits  that  offence  in 
consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B 
to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. 

Explanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that 
the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the 
conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. 

A  concerts  with  B  a  plan  for  poisoning  Z.  It  is  agreed  that  A  shall  administer  the  poison.  B  then  explains  the  plan  to  C 
mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and 
procures  and  delivers  it  to  B  for  the  purpose  of  its  being  used  in  the  manner  explained.  A  administers  the  poison;  Z  dies  in 
consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which 
Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. 

1[108A.  Abetment  in  India  of  offences  outside  India.—A  person  abets  an  offence  within  the 
meaning  of  this  Code  who,  in  2[India],  abets  the  commission  of  any  act  without  and  beyond  2[India] 
which would constitute an offence if committed in 2[India]. 

A, in 2[India], instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] 

109.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  the  act  abetted  is  committed  in  consequence  and  where  no 
express provision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is 
committed  in  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  no  express  provision  is  made  by  this  Code  for  the 
punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. 

Explanation.—An  act  or  offence  is  said  to  be  committed  in  consequence  of  abetment,  when  it  is 
committed  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  or  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy,  or  with  the  aid  which 
constitutes the abetment. 

(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B 

accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161.

(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting 

that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. 

(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he 
may  administer  it  to  Z.  B,  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy,  administers  the  poison  to  Z  in  A's  absence  and  thereby  causes  Z's 
death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. 

110.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  person  abetted  does  act  with  different  intention  from  that  of 
abettor.—Whoever  abets  the  commission  of  an  offence  shall,  if  the  person  abetted  does the  act  with  a 
different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for 
the offence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge 
of the abettor and with no other. 

111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted 
and a different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent 
as if he had directly abetted it: 

Provided  the  act  done  was  a  probable  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  was  committed  under  the 
influence  of  the  instigation,  or  with  the  aid  or  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy  which  constituted  the 
abetment. 

Illustrations 

(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The 
child, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the 
side of that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A's instigation, and the act done was 
under the circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to 
the same extent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. 

(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house. B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of 
property there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for 
the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. 

(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and 
provides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of 
the inmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to 
the punishment provided for murder. 

112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act 
for which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, 
and constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. 

A instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the 
resistance,  B  voluntarily  causes  grievous  hurt  to  the  officer  executing  the  distress.  As  B  has  committed  both  the  offence  of 
resisting the distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, 
if A knew that B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each 
of the offences. 

113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by 
the abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular 
effect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect 
from that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the 
same extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the 
act abetted was likely to cause that effect. 

Illustration 

Illustration 

A  instigates  B  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  causes  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  Z  dies  in 
consequence.  Here,  if  A  knew  that  the  grievous  hurt  abetted  was  likely  to  cause  death,  A  is  liable  to  be  punished  with  the 
punishment provided for murder. 

114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person, who is absent would be 
liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in 
consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. 

 

33 

115.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—if  offence  not 
committed.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or 1[imprisonment for 
life], shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is 
made  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either 
description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; 

if  act  causing  harm  be  done  in  consequence.—and  if  any  act  for  which  the  abettor  is  liable  in 
consequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to 
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable 
to fine. 

Illustration 

A  instigates  B  to  murder  Z.  The  offence  is  not  committed.  If  B  had  murdered  Z,  he  would  have  been  subject  to  the 
punishment  of  death  or  1[imprisonment  for  life].  Therefore  A  is  liable  to  imprisonment  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  seven 
years and also to a fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term 
which may extend to fourteen years, and to fine. 

116.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  imprisonment—if  offence  be  not  committed.—
Whoever  abets  an  offence  punishable  with  imprisonment  shall,  if  that  offence  be  not  committed  in 
consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such 
abetment, be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which 
may  extend  to  one-fourth  part  of  the  longest  term  provided  for  that  offence;  or  with  such  fine  as  is 
provided for that offence, or with both; 

if abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the 
abettor  or  the  person  abetted  is  a  public  servant,  whose  duty  it  is  to  prevent  the  commission  of  such 
offence, the abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for 
a term which may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is 
provided for the offence, or with both. 

Illustrations 

(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A some favour in the exercise of B's official functions. B 

refuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section. 

(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence 

defined in this section, and is punishable accordingly. 

(c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not 

committed, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine. 

(d) B abets the commission of a  robbery by  A, a police-officer,  whose duty it is to prevent that offence. Here, though the 
robbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and 
also to fine. 

117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets 
the commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, 
shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or 
with fine, or with both.

118.  Concealing  design  to  commit  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—
Whoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of 
an offence punishable with death or 1[imprisonment for life],

The dacoity is committed at B in pursuance of the design. A is punishable under this section. 

119.  Public  servant  concealing  design  to  commit  offence  which  it  is  his  duty  to  prevent.—
Whoever,  being  a  public  servant  intending  to  facilitate  or  knowing  it  to  be  likely  that  he  will  thereby 
facilitate the commission of an offence which it is his duty as such public servant to prevent, 

1[voluntarily  conceals,  by  any  act  or  illegal  omission  or  by  the  use  of  encryption  or  any  other

commission of that offence. Here A has by an illegal omission concealed the existence of B's design, and is liable to punishment 
according to the provision of this section. 

120. Concealing design to commit offence punishable with imprisonment.—Whoever, intending 
to  facilitate  or  knowing  it  to  be  likely  that  he  will  thereby  facilitate  the  commission  of  an  offence 
punishable with imprisonment,

(2)  an  act  which  is  not  illegal  by  illegal  means,  such  an  agreement  is  designated  a  criminal 

conspiracy: 

Provided  that  no  agreement  except  an  agreement  to  commit  an  offence  shall  amount  to  a  criminal 
conspiracy  unless  some  act  besides the  agreement is done  by  one  or  more  parties  to such  agreement  in 
pursuance thereof. 

Explanation.—It is immaterial whether the illegal act is the ultimate object of such agreement, or is 

merely incidental to that object. 

120B.  Punishment  of  criminal  conspiracy.—(1)  Whoever  is  a  party  to  a  criminal  conspiracy  to 
commit an offence punishable with death, 1[imprisonment for life] or rigorous imprisonment for a term of 
two years or upwards, shall, where no express provision is made in this Code for the punishment of such a 
conspiracy, be punished in the same manner as if he had abetted such offence. 

(2) Whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy other than a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence 
punishable  as  aforesaid  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  not 
exceeding six months, or with fine or with both.]

CHAPTER XI 

OF FALSE EVIDENCEAND OFFENCES AGAINST PUBLIC JUSTICE 

191. Giving false evidence.—Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of 
law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any statement 
which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true, is said to 
give false evidence. 

Explanation1.—A  statement  is  within  the  meaning  of  this  section,  whether  it  is  made  verbally  or 

otherwise. 

Explanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the meaning of this 
section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing which he 
does not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing which he does not know. 

Illustrations 

(a) A, in support of a just claim  which B has  against Z for one thousand rupees, falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z 

admit the justice of B's claim. A has given false evidence. 

(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when 
he  does  not  believe  it  to  be  the  handwriting  of  Z.  Here  A  states  that  which  he  knows  to  be  false,  and  therefore  gives  false 
evidence. 

(c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of 
Z; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, 
although the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence. 

(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not 

knowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not. 

(e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true interpretation or translation of a statement or document which 
he is bound by oath to interpret or translate truly, that which is not and which he does not believe to be a true interpretation or 
translation. A has given false evidence. 

192.  Fabricating  false  evidence.—Whoever  causes  any  circumstance  to  exist  or  1[makes  any  false 
entry in any book or record, or electronic record or makes any document or electronic record containing a 
false statement,] intending that such circumstance, false entry or false statement may appear in evidence 

                                                           
1. Subs. by Act 21 of 2000, s. 91 and the First Sch., for certain words (w.e.f. 17-10-2000). 

 

50 

in  a  judicial  proceeding,  or  in  a  proceeding  taken  by  law  before  a  public  servant  as  such,  or  before  an 
arbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause 
any  person  who  in  such  proceeding  is  to  form  an  opinion  upon  the  evidence,  to  entertain  an  erroneous 
opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding is said “to fabricate false evidence”. 

Illustrations 

(a) A puts jewels into a box belonging to Z, with the intention that they may be found in that box, and that this circumstance 

may cause Z to be convicted of theft. A has fabricated false evidence. 

(b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of using it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice. A has 

fabricated false evidence. 

(c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z's handwriting, 
purporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the 
officers of the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence. 

193.  Punishment  for  false  evidence.—Whoever  intentionally  gives  false  evidence  in  any  of  a 
judicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial 
proceeding,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to 
seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; 

and whoever intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case, shall be punished with 
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to 
fine. 

Explanation 1.—A trial before a Court-martial1***is a judicial proceeding. 

Explanation  2.—An  investigation  directed  by  law  preliminary  to  a  proceeding  before  a  Court  of 
Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may not take place before a Court of 
Justice. 

A, in an enquiry before a Magistrate  for the purpose of ascertaining whether Z ought to be committed for trial,  makes on 

oath a statement which he knows to be false. As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A as given false evidence. 

Explanation  3.—An  investigation  directed  by  a  Court  of  Justice  according  to  law,  and  conducted 
under the authority of a Court of Justice, is a stage of a judicial proceeding, though that investigation may 
not take place before a Court of Justice. 

Illustration 

Illustration 

A, in an enquiry before an officer deputed by a Court of Justice to ascertain on the spot the boundaries of land, makes on 

oath a statement which he knows to be false. As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding, A has given false evidence.

and executed in consequence of such false evidence, the person who gives such false evidence shall be 
punished either with death or the punishment hereinbefore described. 

195. Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of offence punishable 
with  imprisonment  for  life  or  imprisonment.—Whoever  gives  or  fabricates  false  evidence  intending 
thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that  he will thereby cause, any person to be  convicted of an 
offence  which  2[by  the  law  for  the  time  being  in  force  in  3[India]]  is  not  capital,  but  punishable  with 
4[imprisonment  for  life],  or  imprisonment  for  a  term  of  seven  years  or  upwards,  shall  be  punished  as a 
person convicted of that offence would be liable to be punished.

CHAPTER XVI 

OF OFFENCESAFFECTINGTHE HUMAN BODY 

Of offences affecting life 

299.  Culpable  homicide.—Whoever  causes  death  by  doing  an  act  with  the  intention  of  causing 
death,  or  with  the  intention  of  causing  such  bodily  injury  as  is  likely  to  cause  death,  or  with  the 
knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                           
1. Ins. by Act 25 of 1927, s. 2. 
2. Subs. by the A. O. 1950, for “His Majesty’s subjects”. 
3. Subs. by Act 41 of 1961, s. 3, for certain words. 
4. Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for “two years”. 

69 

Illustrations 

(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to 
be thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable 
homicide. 

(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, 
induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable 
homicide. 

(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. 
Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause 
death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. 

Explanation  1.—A  person  who  causes  bodily  injury  to  another  who  is  labouring  under  a  disorder, 
disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused 
his death. 

Explanation  2.—Where  death is  caused  by  bodily  injury,  the  person  who causes  such  bodily  injury 
shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment 
the death might have been prevented. 

Explanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may 
amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought 
forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. 

300. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by 

which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— 

2ndly.—If  it  is  done  with  the  intention  of  causing  such  bodily  injury  as  the  offender  knows  to  be 

likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— 

3rdly.—If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury 

intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— 

4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all 
probability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without 
any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. 

Illustrations 

(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. 

(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention 
of  causing  bodily  injury.  Z  dies  in  consequence  of  the  blow.  A  is  guilty  of  murder,  although  the  blow  might  not  have  been 
sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is 
labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of 
health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such 
bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. 

(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. 

Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. 

(d)  A  without  any  excuse  fires  a  loaded  cannon  into  a  crowd  of  persons  and  kills  one  of  them.  A  is  guilty  of  murder, 

although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. 

Exception  1.—When  culpable  homicide  is  not  murder.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the 
offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death 
of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. 

The above exception is subject to the following provisos:— 

First.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for 

killing or doing harm to any person. 

Secondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public 

servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. 

Thirdly.—That the  provocation  is  not  given  by  anything  done  in  the  lawful  exercise  of  the  right  of 

private defence. 

 

70 

Explanation.—Whether  the  provocation  was  grave  and  sudden  enough  to  prevent  the  offence  from 

amounting to murder is a question of fact. 

Illustrations 

(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, 
inasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in 
doing an act caused by the provocation. 

(b) Y gives  grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending  nor knowing 
himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable 
homicide. 

(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, 

inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. 

(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has 

perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. 

(e)A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. 
A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by 
a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. 

(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and 
to  cause  him  to  kill Z, puts  a  knife  into  B's  hand  for  that purpose.  B  kills  Z  with  the  knife.  Here  B  may  have  committed  only 
culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. 

Exception  2.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the  offender  in  the  exercise  in  good  faith  of  the 
right  of  private  defence  of  person  or  property,  exceeds  the  power  given  to  him  by  law  and  causes  the 
death  of  the  person  against  whom  he  is  exercising  such  right  of  defence  without  premeditation,  and 
without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. 

Illustration 

Z  attempts  to  horsewhip  A,  not  in  such  a  manner  as  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  A.  A  draws  out  a  pistol.  Z  persists  in  the 
assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has 
not committed murder, but only culpable homicide. 

Exception  3.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the  offender,  being  a  public  servant  or  aiding  a 
public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and 
causes  death  by  doing  an  act  which  he,  in  good  faith,  believes  to  be  lawful  and  necessary  for  the  due 
discharge  of  his  duty  as  such  public  servant  and  without  ill-will  towards  the  person  whose  death  is 
caused. 

Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden 
fight  in  the  heat  of  passion  upon  a  sudden  quarrel  and  without  the  offender's  having  taken  undue 
advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. 

Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first 

assault. 

Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above 

the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. 

Illustration 

A,  by  instigation,  voluntarily  causes  Z,  a  person  under  eighteen  years  of  age  to  commit  suicide.  Here,  on  account  of  Z's 

youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. 

301.  Culpable  homicide  by  causing  death  of  person  other  than  person  whose  death  was 
intended.—If  a  person,  by  doing  anything  which  he  intends  or  knows  to  be  likely  to  cause  death, 
commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows 
himself  to  be  likely  to  cause,  the  culpable  homicide  committed  by  the  offender  is  of  the  description  of 
which  it  would  have  been  if  he  had  caused  the  death  of  the  person  whose  death  he  intended  or  knew 
himself to he likely to cause.

Of Criminal Force and Assault 

349.  Force.—A  person  is  said  to  use  force  to  another  if  he  causes  motion,  change  of  motion,  or 
cessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or 
cessation  of  motion  as  brings  that  substance  into  contact  with  any  part  of  that  other's  body,  or  with 
anything which that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that 
other's sense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of 
motion, causes that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter 
described: 

First.—By his own bodily power. 

Secondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of 

motion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person. 

Thirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move. 

350. Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person's consent, 
in order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to 
be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the 
force is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. 

(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the 
stream. Here  A intentionally causes  motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is 
produced  without  any  other  action  on  any  person's  part.  A  has  therefore  intentionally  used  force  to  Z;  and  if  he  has  done  so 

Illustrations

without Z's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will 
cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. 

(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of 
motion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's 
consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. 

(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of 
motion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, 
without Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. 

(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring 
it  into  contact  with  Z.  He  has  therefore  intentionally  used  force  to  Z;  and  if  he  has  done  so  without  Z's  consent,  intending  or 
knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. 

(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or  with Z's 
clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried 
by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A 
has used force to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal 
force to Z. 

(f)  A  intentionally  pulls  up  a  Woman's  veil.  Here  A  intentionally  uses  force  to  her,  and  if  he does so  without  her  consent 

intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. 

(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power 
causes such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact 
must  affect  Z's  sense  of  feeling;  A  has  therefore  intentionally  used  force  to  Z;  and  if  he  has  done  this  without  Z's  consent 
intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. 

(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses 

criminal force to Z. 

351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely 
that  such  gesture  or  preparation  will  cause  any  person  present  to  apprehend  that  he  who  makes  that 
gesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. 

Explanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give 
to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations  amount to an 
assault. 

Illustrations 

(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike 

Z. A has committed an assault. 

(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to 

believe that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. 

(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to 
an assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture 
explained by the words may amount to an assault. 

352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever 
assaults  or uses  criminal force  to  any  person  otherwise than  on  grave  and  sudden  provocation  given  by 
that  person,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to 
three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. 

Explanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under 
this  section,  if  the  provocation  is  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the  offender  as  an  excuse  for  the 
offence, or 

if the  provocation  is  given  by  anything  done in obedience  to  the law, or  by  a  public servant, in the 

lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or 

if the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. 

 Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact. 

353.  Assault  or  criminal  force  to  deter  public  servant  from  discharge  of  his  duty.—Whoever 
assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such 
public  servant,  or  with  intent  to  prevent  or  deter  that  person  from  discharging  his  duty  as  such  public 
servant,  or  in  consequence  of  anything  done  or  attempted  to  be  done  by  such  person  to  the  lawful

than three years but which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. 

354C. Voyeurism.—Any man who watches, or captures the image of a woman engaging in a private 
act in  circumstances  where  she  would  usually  have  the  expectation  of  not  being  observed  either  by  the

second or subsequent conviction, with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be 
less than three years, but which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. 

 Explanation 1.—For the purpose of this section, “private act” includes an act of watching carried out 
in a place which, in the circumstances, would reasonably be expected to provide privacy and where the 
victim's genitals, posterior or breasts are exposed or covered only in underwear; or the victim is using a 
lavatory; or the victim is doing a sexual act that is not of a kind ordinarily done in public. 

Explanation 2.—Where the victim consents to the capture of the images or any act, but not to their

Provided that such conduct shall not amount to stalking if the man who pursued it proves that— 

(i) it  was  pursued  for  the purpose  of  preventing  or  detecting  crime  and  the  man  accused  of 
stalking  had  been  entrusted  with  the  responsibility  of  prevention  and  detection  of  crime  by  the

CHAPTER XVII 

OF OFFENCESAGAINST PROPERTY 

Of Theft 

378. Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of 
any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit 
theft. 

Explanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the 
subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. 

Explanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. 

Explanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented 

it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. 

Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, 

and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. 

Explanation  5.—The  consent  mentioned  in  the  definition  may  be  express  or  implied,  and  may  be 
given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express 
or implied. 

Illustrations 

(a)  A  cuts  down  a  tree  on  Z's  ground,  with  the  intention  of  dishonestly  taking  the  tree  out  of  Z's  possession  without  Z's 

consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. 

(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the 

dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. 

(c)  A  meets  a  bullock  carrying  a  box  of  treasure.  He  drives  the  bullock  in  a  certain  direction,  in  order  that  he  may 

dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. 

                                                           
1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). 

 

88 

(d)  A  being  Z's  servant,  and  entrusted  by  Z  with  the  care  of  Z's  plate,  dishonestly  runs  away  with  the  plate,  without  Z's 

consent. A has committed theft. 

(e)  Z,  going  on  a  journey,  entrusts  his  plate  to  A,  the  keeper  of  a  warehouse,  till  Z  shall  return.  A  carries  the  plate  to  a 
goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and  A has 
not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. 

(f)  A  finds  a  ring  belonging  to  Z  on  a  table  in  the  house  which  Z  occupies.  Here  the  ring  is  in  Z's  possession,  and  if  A 

dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. 

(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he 

may commit criminal misappropriation of property. 

(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear 
of  search  and  detection,  A  hides  the  ring  in  a  place  where  it  is  highly  improbable  that  it  will  ever  be  found  by  Z,  with  the 
intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first  moving the 
ring, commits theft. 

(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for 
which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, 
and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as 
what he did was not done dishonestly.  

(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes 
the  watch  out  of  Z's  possession,  with  the  intention  of  depriving  Z  of  the  property  as  a  security  for  his  debt,  he  commits  theft, 
inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. 

(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he 

borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. 

(l)  A  takes  an  article  belonging  to  Z  out  of  Z's  possession  without  Z's  consent,  with  the  intention  of  keeping  it  until  he 

obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. 

(m)  A,  being  on  friendly  terms  with  Z,  goes  into  Z's  library  in  Z's  absence,  and  takes  away  a  book  without  Z's  express 
consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived 
that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. 

(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it 
is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed 
theft. 

(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such 

property as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. 

(p)  A,  in  good  faith,  believing  property  belonging  to  Z  to be  A's  own  property,  takes  that  property  out  of  B's  possession. 

Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. 

379. Punishment for theft.—Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either 

description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. 

380.  Theft  in  dwelling  house,  etc.—Whoever  commits  theft  in  any  building,  tent  or  vessel,  which 
building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or used for the custody of property, shall be punished 
with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  seven  years,  and  shall  also  be 
liable to fine. 

381.  Theft  by  clerk  or servant  of  property  in  possession  of master.—Whoever,  being  a  clerk  or 
servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, commits theft in respect of any property 
in the possession of his master or employer, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for 
a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.  

382.  Theft  after  preparation  made  for  causing  death,  hurt  or  restraint  in  order  to  the 
committing of the theft.—Whoever commits theft, having made preparation for causing death, or hurt, 
or restraint, or fear of death, or of hurt, or of restraint, to any person, in order to the committing of such 
theft,  or  in  order  to  the  effecting  of  his  escape  after  the  committing  of  such  theft,  or  in  order  to  the 
retaining of property taken by such theft, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which 
may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. 

(a) A commits theft on property in Z's possession; and while committing this theft, he has a loaded pistol under his garment, 
having  provided  this  pistol  for  the  purpose  of  hurting  Z  in  case  Z  should  resist.  A  has  committed  the  offence  defined  in  this 
section.

(b)  A  picks  Z's  pocket,  having  posted  several  of  his  companions  near  him,  in  order  that  they  may  restrain  Z,  if  Z  should 
perceive what is passing and should resist, or should attempt to apprehend A. A has committed the offence defined in this section. 

383. Extortion.—Whoever intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury to that person, or to any 
other, and thereby dishonestly induces the person so put in fear to deliver to any person any property, or 
valuable security or anything signed or sealed which may be converted into a valuable security, commits 
“extortion”. 

Of Extortion 

Illustrations 

(a) A threatens to publish a defamatory libel concerning Z unless Z gives him money. He thus induces Z to give him money. 

A has committed extortion. 

(b) A threatens Z that he will keep Z's child in wrongful confinement, unless Z will sign and deliver to A a promissory note 

binding Z to pay certain monies to A. Z sings and delivers the note. A has committed extortion. 

(c) A threatens to send club-men to plough up Z's field unless Z will sign and deliver to B a bond binding Z under a penalty 

to deliver certain produce to B, and thereby induces Z to sign and deliver the bond. A has committed extortion. 

(d) A, by putting Z in fear of grievous hurt, dishonestly induces Z to sign or affix his seal to a blank paper and deliver it to 
A. Z sings and delivers the paper to A. Here, as the paper so signed may be converted into a valuable security. A has committed 
extortion. 

384. Punishment for extortion.—Whoever commits extortion shall be punished with imprisonment 

of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. 

385.  Putting  person  in  fear  of  injury  in  order  to  commit  extortion.—Whoever,  in  order  to  the 
committing of extortion, puts any person in fear, or attempts to put any person in fear, of any injury, shall 
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with

Of Robbery and Dacoity 

When  theft  is  robbery.—Theft  is  “robbery”  if,  in  order  to  the  committing  of  the  theft,  or  in 
committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the

offender,  for  that  end  voluntarily  causes  or  attempts  to  cause  to  any  person  death  or  hurt  or  wrongful 
restraint, or fear of instant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. 

When extortion is robbery.—Extortion is  “robbery” if the offender, at the time of committing the 
extortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in 
fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person, 
and, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted. 

Explanation.—The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in 

fear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. 

Illustrations 

(a)  A  holds  Z  down,  and  fraudulently  takes  Z's  money  and  jewels  from  Z's  clothes,  without  Z's  consent.  Here  A  has 
committed  theft,  and,  in  order  to  the  committing  of  that  theft,  has  voluntarily  caused  wrongful  restraint  to  Z.  A  has  therefore 
committed robbery. 

(b) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has 
extorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. 
A has therefore committed robbery. 

(c) A meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to filing it down a precipice, unless Z delivers 
his purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to 
the child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z. 

(d) A obtains property from Z by saying “Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us 
ten thousand rupees”. This is extortion, and punishable as such: but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of 
his child. 

391.  Dacoity.—When  five  or  more  persons  conjointly  commit  or  attempt  to  commit  a  robbery,  or 
where  the  whole  number  of  persons  conjointly  committing  or  attempting  to  commit  a  robbery,  and 
persons  present  and  aiding  such  commission  or  attempt,  amount  to  five  or  more,  every  person  so 
committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit “dacoity”. 

392.  Punishment  for  robbery.—Whoever  commits  robbery  shall  be  punished  with  rigorous 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and, if the robbery

attempting  to  commit  robbery,  voluntarily  causes  hurt,  such  person,  and  any  other  person  jointly 
concerned  in  committing  or  attempting  to commit  such  robbery,  shall  be  punished  with  1[imprisonment 
for life], or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable 
to fine. 

395. Punishment for dacoity.—Whoever commits dacoity shall be punished with 1[imprisonment for 
life], or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to 
fine. 

396.  Dacoity  with  murder.—If  any  one  of  five  or  more  persons,  who  are  conjointly  committing 
dacoity,  commits  murder  in  so  committing  dacoity,  every  one  of  those  persons  shall  be  punished  with 
death,  or  1[imprisonment  for  life],  or  rigorous  imprisonment  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  ten  years, 
and shall also be liable to fine. 

397.  Robbery,  or  dacoity,  with  attempt  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt.—If,  at  the  time  of 
committing  robbery  or  dacoity,  the  offender  uses  any  deadly  weapon,  or  causes  grievous  hurt  to  any 
person,  or  attempts  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt  to  any  person,  the  imprisonment  with  which  such 
offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years. 

398. Attempt to commit robbery or dacoitywhen armed with deadly weapon.—If, at the time of 
attempting  to  commit  robbery  or  dacoity,  the  offender  is  armed  with  any  deadly  weapon,  the 
imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years.

401. Punishment for belonging to gang of thieves.—Whoever, at any time after the passing of this 
Act,  shall  belong  to  any  wandering  or  other  gang  of  persons  associated  for  the  purpose  of  habitually

imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine. 

402.  Assembling  for  purpose  of  committing  dacoity.—Whoever,  at  any  time  after  the  passing  of 
this Act, shall be one of five or more persons assembled for the purpose of committing dacoity, shall be

to fine. 

Of Criminal Misappropriation of Property 

403.  Dishonest  misappropriation  of  property.—Whoever  dishonestly  misappropriates  or  converts 
to  his  own  use  any  movable  property,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description  for  a 
term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. 

Illustrations 

(a)  A  takes  property  belonging  to  Z  out  of  Z's  possession,  in  good  faith  believing  at  the  time  when  he  takes  it,  that  the 
property belongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property 
to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 

(b)  A,  being  on  friendly  terms  with  Z,  goes  into  Z's  library  in  Z's  absence,  and  takes  away  a  book  without  Z's  express 
consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has 
not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 

(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right 
to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his 
own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section. 

Explanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation with the meaning 

of this section. 

Illustration 

A finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, 
pledges it with a banker as a security or a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this 
section. 

Explanation  2.—A  person  who  finds  property  not  in  the  possession  of  any  other  person,  and  takes 
such  property  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  it  for,  or  of  restoring  it  to,  the  owner,  does  not  take  or 
misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, 
if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before 
he  has  used  reasonable  means  to  discover  and  give  notice  to  the  owner  and  has  kept  the  property  a 
reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it. 

What are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact. 

It is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular 
person is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his 
own property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found. 

(a)  A  finds  a  rupee  on  the  high  road,  not  knowing  to  whom  the  rupee  belongs,  A  picks  up  the  rupee.  Here  A  has  not 

committed the offence defined in this section.

(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the 

note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section. 

(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of 
the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque 
was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section. 

(d)  A  sees  Z  drop  his  purse  with  money  in  it.  A  picks  up  the  purse  with  the  intention of  restoring  it  to  Z,  but  afterwards 

appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section. 

(e)  A  finds  a  purse  with  money,  not  knowing  to  whom  it  belongs;  he  afterwards  discovers  that  it  belongs  to  Z,  and 

appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section. 

(f)  A  finds  a  valuable  ring,  not  knowing  to  whom  it  belongs.  A  sells  it  immediately  without  attempting  to  discover  the 

owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section. 

404.  Dishonest  misappropriation  of  property  possessed  by  deceased  person  at  the  time  of  his 
death.—Whoever  dishonestly  misappropriates  or  converts  to  his  own  use  property,  knowing  that  such 
property was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that person's decease, and has not since 
been  in  the  possession  of  any  person  legally  entitled  to  such  possession,  shall  be  punished  with 
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to 
fine, and if the offender at the time of such person's decease was employed by him as a clerk or servant, 
the imprisonment may extend to seven years. 

Z  dies  in  possession  of  furniture  and  money.  His  servant  A,  before  the  money  comes  into  the  possession  of  any  person 

entitled to such possession, dishonestly misappropriates it. A has committed the offence defined in this section.

(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. 

A fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. 

(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill 
up the cheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently 
fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. 

(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill 
with  a  banker  and  intending  to  take  up  the  bill  on  its  maturity.  Here,  as  A  draws  the  bill  with  intent  to deceive  the  banker  by 
leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. 

(f)  Z's  will  contains  these  words—“I  direct  that  all  my  remaining  property  be  equally  divided  between  A,  B  and  C.”  A 
dishonestly scratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself  and C. A has committed 
forgery. 

(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay 
to Z or his order” and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the 
special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. 

(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same 
estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed  the 
estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. 

(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has 

prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. 

(j)  A  writes  a  letter  and  signs  it  with  B's  name  without  B's  authority,  certifying  that  A  is  a  man  of  good  character  and  in 
distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. 
Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. 

(k)  A  without  B's  authority  writes  a  letter  and  signs  it  in  B's  name  certifying  to  A's  character,  intending  thereby  to obtain 
employment under Z. A has committed  forgery inasmuch  as he intended to deceive Z by the  forged certificate, and thereby to 
induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service. 

Explanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. 

Illustrations 

(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person 

of the same name. A has committed forgery. 

(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the 
paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; 
and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. 

(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own 
name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed 
forgery. 

(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, 
executes a lease of the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with 
intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in 
his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. 

(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; 
and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, 
and  antedates  the  note,  intending  that  it  may  be  believed  to  have  been  made  before  A  was  on  the  point  of  insolvency.  A  has 
committed forgery under the first head of the definition. 

Explanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be 
believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to 
be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.

Note

Article 129

Article 131

The Supreme Court shall be the court of record and has all the powers
of such a court, including the power to punish for contempt of itself.

The   Supreme   Court   has   the   original   jurisdiction   in   any   dispute
between the Government of India and one or more States; or between
the Government of India and any State or States on one side and one
or more other States on the other; or between two or more States.

8

An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree
or final order, in a civil, criminal or other proceeding, if the High
Court certifies under Article 134A that the case involves a substantial
question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution.

An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree
or final order in a civil proceeding of a High Court in the territory of
India,   if   the   High   Court   certifies   under   Article   134A   of   the
Constitution that the case involves a substantial question of law of
general importance and, in the opinion of the High Court, the said
question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court. 

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article, no appeal
shall,   unless   Parliament   by   law   or   otherwise   provides,   lie   to   the
Supreme Court from the judgment, decree or final order of one Judge
of a High Court.

Article 132

Article 133

Article 134

An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, final
order or sentence in a criminal proceeding of a High Court in the
territory of India, if the High Court has, on appeal, reversed an order
of acquittal of an accused person and sentenced him to death; or has
withdrawn for trial before itself any case from any court subordinate
to its authority and has, in such trial, convicted the accused person and
sentenced him to death; or if the High Court certifies under Article
134A that the case is a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court, subject
to the proviso thereunder.

9

Article 136

Notwithstanding   anything   contained   in   Chapter   IV   of   the
Constitution, the Supreme Court may in its discretion, grant special
leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or
order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal,
except in relation to any court or tribunal constituted by or under any
law relating to the armed forces.

Article 136 does not confer a right of appeal on any party but it
confers a discretionary power on the Supreme Court to interfere in
suitable cases.  

The jurisdiction conferred by Article 136  is divisible into two
stages; first stage is upto the disposal of prayer for special leave to file
an appeal and the second stage commences if and when the leave to
appeal   is   granted   and   special   leave   petition   is   converted   into   an
appeal.

Under Article 136, the Supreme Court may reverse, modify or
affirm the judgment, decree or order appealed against while exercising
its appellate jurisdiction and not while exercising the discretionary
jurisdiction   disposing   of   petition   for   special   leave   to   appeal.  The
doctrine of merger, therefore, applies to the former and not to the
latter. Once leave to appeal has been granted and appellate jurisdiction
of Supreme Court has been invoked, the order passed in appeal would
attract   the   doctrine   of   merger;   the   order   may   be   of   reversal,
modification or merely affirmation.

On an appeal having been preferred or a petition seeking leave
to appeal having been converted into an appeal before the Supreme
Court, the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a review petition
is lost thereafter, as provided by sub-rule (1) of Rule (1) of Order 47
of the Code.

10

Article 137

Subject to the provisions of any law made by the Parliament or any
rules made under Article 145, the Supreme Court shall have the power
to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it.

The Supreme Court has held that “by describing an
application as one for clarification or modification, though
it is one for review, a party cannot be permitted to
circumvent or bypass the circulation procedure and
indirectly obtain a hearing in the open court. The Court has
further held that what cannot be done directly cannot be
permitted to be done indirectly and that an application for
‘clarification’, ‘modification’ or ‘recall’ cannot be
entertained where, in sum and substance, the same is
clever move for review [APSRTC and Others v. Abdul
Kareem [2007 (2) SCC 466].

Article 139A(1)

Where cases involving the same or substantially the same questions of
law are pending before the Supreme Court and one or more High
Courts or before two or more High Courts and the Supreme Court is
satisfied on its own motion or an application made by the Attorney-
General of India or by a party to any such  case that such questions are
substantial questions of general importance, the Supreme Court may
withdraw the case or cases pending before the High Court or the High
Courts and dispose of all the cases itself:

Provided that the Supreme Court may after determining the said
questions of law return any case so withdrawn together with a copy of
its judgment on such questions to the High Court from which the case
has been withdrawn and the High Court shall, on receipt thereof,

during   the   pendency   of   the   case,   having   served   out   the   sentence
awarded   by   the   Court   below,  does   not   render   the   petition/appeal
infructuous but the said fact shall expeditiously be brought to the
notice of the Court.
In case of default in compliance with the directions of the Court or
with any requirement of the Rules, practice and procedure, the case
shall be placed before the Court along with appropriate office report

CHAPTER XXV
FIRST SCHEDULE 

RULES AS TO PRINTING OF RECORD

The record in appeals to the Court shall be printed in the form known
as demy quarto on both sides of the paper with single spacing.
The size of the paper used shall be such that the sheet, when folded
and trimmed, will be about 11 inches in height and 81/2 inches in width
or 29.7 cm. in height and 21 cm. in width.
The type to be used in the text shall be pica type but “Long Primer”
shall be used in printing accounts, tabular matter and notes.   Every
tenth line shall be numbered in the margin.
Records shall be arranged in two parts in the same volume, where
practicable, viz.--
Part I- The pleadings and proceedings, the transcript of the evidence
of the witnesses, the judgments, decrees, etc., of the Courts below,
down to the orders admitting the appeal.
Part II- The exhibits and documents.
The Index to Part I shall be in chronological order, and shall be placed
at the beginning of the volume.
The Index to Part II shall follow the order of the exhibit mark, and
shall be placed immediately after the Index to Part I.
Part I shall be arranged strictly in chronological order, i.e., in the same
order as the index.
Part II shall be arranged in the most convenient way for the use of the
Court, as the circumstances of the case require.  The documents shall
be printed as far as suitable in chronological order, mixing plaintiff’s
and defendant’s documents together when necessary.  Each document
shall   show   its   exhibit   mark,   and   whether   it   is   a   plaintiff’s   or
defendant’s document (unless this is clear from the exhibit mark) and
in all cases documents relating to the same matter such as:-

205

(a)
(b)

a series of correspondence, or
proceedings in a suit other than the one under appeal, shall be 
kept together.  The order in the record of the documents in Part 
II will probably be different from the order of the Index, and the
proper page number of each document shall be inserted in the 
printed Index.
The   parties   will   be   responsible   for   arranging   the   record   in
proper order for the Court, and in difficult cases counsel may be asked
to settle it.
The   documents   in   Part   I   shall   be   numbered   consecutively.   The
documents in Part II shall not be numbered, apart from the exhibit
mark.
Each   document   shall   have   a   heading   which   shall   consist   of   the
number of exhibit mark and the description of the document in the
Index, without the date.
Each document shall have a heading which shall be repeated at the top
of each page over which the document extends, viz.--

7.

8.

9.

PART I

(b)

(a) Where the case has been before more than one court the short name of
the court shall first appear.  Where the case has been before only one
court, the name of the court need not appear.
The  heading   of  the   document   shall   then   appear   consisting   of  the
number and the description of the documents in the Index, with the
date, except in the case of oral evidence.
In the case of oral evidence, ‘plaintiff’s evidence’ or ‘defendant’s
evidence’ shall appear next to the name of the court and then the
number in the Index and the witness’s name,  with ‘examination’,
‘cross-examination’ or ‘re-examination’, as the case may be.

(c)

206

PART II

The word ‘Exhibit’ shall first appear next to it the exhibit mark and the
description of the document in the Index with the date.
Sufficient space shall be left after the heading to distinguish it from the rest
of the matter printed on the page.
10.

The   parties   shall   agree   to   the   omission   of   formal   and   irrelevant
documents, but the description of the document may appear (both in
the Index and the record), if desired, with the words ‘not printed’
against it.

11.

A   long   series   of   documents,   such   as   accounts,   rent   rolls,
inventories, etc., shall not be printed in full, unless counsel advises,
but the parties shall agree to short extracts being printed as specimens.
In   case   where   maps  are   of   an   inconvenient   size   or   unsuitable   in
character,   the   appellant   shall,   in   agreement   with   the   respondent,
prepare maps drawn properly to scale and of reasonable size, showing
as far as possible, the claims of the respective parties, in different
colours.

COMPILATION OF GUIDELINES TO BE FOLLOWED FOR

ENTERTAINING LETTERS/PETITIONS RECEIVED

IN THIS COURT AS PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION.

(Based on full Court decision dated 1.12.1988 and subsequent modifications).

Annexure I

No petition involving individual/ personal matter shall be entertained as a PIL matter except as
indicated hereinafter.

Letter-petitions falling under the following categories alone will ordinarily be
entertained as Public Interest Litigation:-

1. 
2. 
3. 

4. 

(5) 

(6) 

Bonded Labour matters.
Neglected Children.
Non-payment of minimum wages to workers and exploitation of casual workers and

Petitions from jails complaining of harassment, for (pre-mature release)* and seeking
release after having completed 14 years in jail, death in jail, transfer, release on personal
bond, speedy trial as a fundamental right.
*$ Petitions for premature release, parole etc. are not matters which deserve to be treated
as petitions u/Article 32 as they can effectively be dealt with by the concerned High
Court.   To   save   time   Registry   may   simultaneously   call   for   remarks   of   the   jail
Superintendent and ask him to forward the same to High Court. The main petition may be
forwarded to the concerned High Court for disposal in accordance with law.
Even in regard to petitions containing allegations against Jail Authorities there is no
reason why it cannot be dealt with by the High Court. But petitions complaining of
torture, custody death and the like may be entertained by this Court directly if the
allegations are of a serious nature.
Petitions against police for refusing to register a case, harassment by police and death in
police custody.
Petitions against atrocities on women, in particular harassment of bride, bride- burning,
rape, murder, kidnapping etc.

+ In such cases where office calls for police report if letter petitioner asks for copy the same may
be supplied, only after obtaining permission of the Hon'ble Judge nominated by the Hon'ble
Chief Justice of India for PIL matters.

food adulteration, maintenance of heritage and culture, antiques, forest and wild life and
other matters of public importance.
Petitions from riot -victims.

(9)  
(10)   Family Pension.

All letter-petitions received in the PIL Cell will first be screened in the Cell and only such
petitions as are covered by the above mentioned categories will be placed before a Judge to be
nominated by Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India for directions after which the case will be listed
before the Bench concerned.

If a letter-petition is to be lodged, the orders to that effect should be passed by Registrar
(Judicial)   (or   any   Registrar   nominated   by   the   Hon'ble   Chief   Justice   of   India),   instead   of
Additional Registrar, or any junior officer. 

To begin with only one Hon'ble Judge may be assigned this work and number increased to two or
three later depending on the workload.

*Submission Notes be put up before an Hon'ble Judge nominated for such periods as may be
decided by the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India from time to time.

**If on scrutiny of a letter petition, it is found that the same is not covered under the PIL
guidelines and no public interest is involved, then the same may be lodged only after the
approval from the Registrar nominated by the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India.

**It may be worthwhile to require an affidavit to be filed in support of the statements contained
in the petition whenever it is not too onerous a requirement.

+ Added as per Order dated 29.8.2003 of the Hon'ble Chief Justice of India.

and these may be returned to the petitioners or filed in the PIL Cell, as the case may be:

(1) 
(2) 
(3) 

(4) 
(5)

Service matter and those pertaining to Pension and Gratuity.
Complaints against Central/ State Government Departments and Local Bodies except  
those relating to item Nos. (1) to (10) above.

published on a specified day, in the manner specified in clause  (i) of sub-section (2), shall be conclusive evidence 

that the requirements of this section have been complied with, and that the proclamation was published on such day.

1[(4)  Where  a  proclamation  published  under  sub-section  (1)  is  in  respect  of  a  person  accused  of  an  offence 
punishable under section 302, 304, 364, 367, 382, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 402, 436, 449, 459 or 

460 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), and such person fails to appear at the specified place and time required

and make a declaration to that effect. 

(5) The provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3) shall apply to a declaration made by the Court under 

sub-section (4) as they apply to the proclamation published under sub-section (1).] 

83.  Attachment of property of person absconding.—(1) The Court issuing a proclamation under 
section 82 may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, at any time after the issue of the proclamation, order 
the attachment of any property, movable or immovable, or both, belonging to the proclaimed person: 

Provided that where at the time of the issue of the proclamation the Court is satisfied, by affidavit or 

otherwise, that the person in relation to whom the proclamation is to be issued,— 

(a) is about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property, or 

(b)  is  about  to  remove  the  whole  or  any  part  of  his  property  from  the  local  jurisdiction  of  the 

Court, 

it may order the attachment simultaneously with the issue of the proclamation. 

(2)  Such  order  shall  authorise  the  attachment  of  any  property  belonging  to  such  person  within  the 
district in which it is made; and it shall authorise the attachment of any property belonging to such person 
without  such  district  when  endorsed  by  the  District  Magistrate  within  whose  district  such  property  is 
situate. 

(3) If the property ordered to be attached is a debt or other movable property, the attachment under 

this section shall be made— 

(a) by seizure; or 

(b) by the appointment of a receiver; or 

(c) by an order in writing prohibiting the delivery of such property to the proclaimed person or to 

any one on his behalf; or 

(d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit. 

(4) If the property ordered to be attached is immovable, the attachment under this section shall, in the 
case  of  land  paying  revenue  to  the  State  Government,  be  made  through  the  Collector  of  the  district  in 
which the land is situate, and in all other cases— 

(a) by taking possession; or 

(b) by the appointment of a receiver; or 

(c)  by  an  order  in  writing  prohibiting  the  payment  of  rent  on  delivery  of  property  to  the 

proclaimed person or to any one on his behalf; or 

(d) by all or any two of such methods, as the Court thinks fit. 

(5) If the property ordered to be attached consists of live-stock or is of a perishable nature, the Court 
may, if it thinks it expedient, order immediate sale thereof, and in such case the proceeds of the sale shall 
abide the order of the Court. 

 (6) The powers, duties and liabilities of a receiver appointed under this section shall be the same as 

those of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908).

84. Claims and objections to attachment.—(1) If any claim is preferred to, or objection made to the 
attachment  of,  any  property  attached  under  section  83,  within  six  months  from  the  date  of  such 
attachment, by any person other than the proclaimed person, on the ground that the claimant or objector 
has  an  interest  in  such  property,  and  that  such  interest  is  not  liable  to  attachment  under  section  83,  the 
claim or objection shall be inquired into, and may be allowed or disallowed in whole or in part: 

Provided  that  any  claim  preferred  or  objection  made  within  the  period  allowed  by  this  sub-section 

may, in the event of the death of the claimant or objector, be continued by his legal representative. 

(2) Claims or objections under sub-section (1) may be preferred or made in the Court by which the 
order of attachment is issued, or, if the claim or objection is in respect of property attached under an order 
endorsed under sub-section (2) of section 83, in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate of the district 
in which the attachment is made. 

(3) Every such claim or objection shall be inquired into by the Court in which it is preferred or made: 

Provided that, if it is preferred or made in the Court of a Chief Judicial Magistrate, he may make it 

over for disposal to any Magistrate subordinate to him. 

(4) Any person whose claim or objection has been disallowed in whole or in part by an order under 
sub-section (1) may, within a period of one year from the date of such order, institute a suit to establish 
the right which he claims in respect of the property in dispute; but subject to the result of such suit, if any, 
the order shall be conclusive. 

85.  Release,  sale  and  restoration  of  attached  property.—(1)  If  the  proclaimed  person  appears 
within the time specified in the proclamation, the Court shall make an order releasing the property from 
the attachment. 

(2)  If  the  proclaimed  person  does  not  appear  within  the  time  specified  in  the  proclamation,  the 
property  under  the  attachment  shall  be at the  disposal  of  the  State  Government; but  it  shall  not  be sold 
until  the  expiration  of  six  months  from  the  date  of  the  attachment  and  until  any  claim  preferred  or 
objection made under section 84 has been disposed of under that section, unless it is subject to speedy and 
natural decay, or the Court considers that the sale would be for the benefit of the owner; in either of which 
cases the Court may cause it to be sold whenever it thinks fit. 

(3) If, within two years from the date of the attachment, any person whose property is or has been at 
the  disposal  of  the  State  Government,  under  sub-section  (2),  appears  voluntarily  or  is  apprehended  and 
brought before the Court by whose order the property was attached, or the Court to which such Court is 
subordinate, and proves to the satisfaction of such Court that he did not abscond or conceal himself for 
the purpose of avoiding execution of the warrant, and that he had not such notice of the proclamation as to 
enable him to attend within the time specified therein, such property, or,  if  the  same  has  been  sold, the 
net proceeds of the sale, or, if part only thereof has been sold, the net proceeds of the sale and the residue 
of  the  property,  shall,  after  satisfying  therefrom  all costs incurred in  consequence  of the  attachment,  be 
delivered to him. 

86. Appeal from order rejecting application for restoration of attached property.—Any person 
referred  to  in  sub-section  (3)  of  section  85,  who  is  aggrieved  by  any  refusal  to  deliver  property  or  the 
proceeds of the sale thereof may appeal to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the sentences of 
the first-mentioned Court. 

D.—Other rules regarding processes 

87. Issue of warrant in lieu of, or in addition to, summons.—A Court may, in any case in which it 
is empowered by this Code to issue a summons for the appearance of any person, issue, after recording its 
reasons in writing, a warrant for his arrest— 

(a) if, either before the issue of such summons, or after the issue of the same but before the time 
fixed for his appearance, the Court sees reason to believe that he has absconded or will not obey the 
summons; or 

51 

 

(b) if at such time he fails to appear and the summons is proved to have been duly served in time 
to admit of his appearing in accordance therewith and no reasonable excuse is offered for such failure. 

88.  Power  to  take  bond  for  appearance.—When  any  person  for  whose  appearance  or  arrest  the 
officer presiding in any Court is empowered to issue a summons or warrant, is present in such Court, such 
officer  may  require  such  person  to  execute  a bond,  with or  without sureties,  for his appearance in such 
Court, or any other Court to which the case may be transferred for trial. 

89. Arrest on breach of bond for appearance.—When any person who is bound by any bond taken 
under this Code to appear before a Court, does not appear, the officer presiding in such Court may issue a 
warrant directing that such person be arrested and produced before him. 

90. Provisions of this Chapter generally applicable to summonses and warrants of arrest.—The 
provisions  contained  in  this  Chapter  relating  to  a  summons  and  warrant,  and  their  issue,  service  and 
execution, shall, so far as may be, apply to every summons and every warrant of arrest issued under this 
Code. 

PROCESSES TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF THINGS 

CHAPTER VII 

A.—Summons to produce 

91.  Summons  to  produce  document  or  other  thing.—(1)  Whenever  any  Court  or  any  officer  in 
charge  of  a  police  station  considers  that  the  production  of  any  document  or  other  thing  is  necessary  or 
desirable for  the  purposes of  any  investigation, inquiry,  trial  or  other  proceeding  under  this  Code  by  or 
before  such  Court  or  officer,  such  Court  may  issue  a  summons,  or  such  officer  a  written  order,  to  the 
person in whose possession or power such document or thing is believed to be, requiring him to attend 
and produce it, or to produce it, at the time and place stated in the summons or order. 

(2)  Any  person  required  under  this  section  merely  to  produce  a  document  or  other  thing  shall  be 
deemed to have complied with the requisition if he causes such document or thing to be produced instead 
of attending personally to produce the same. 

(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed— 

(a) to affect sections 123 and 124 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), or the Bankers’ 

Books Evidence Act, 1891 (13 of 1891), or 

(b) to apply to a letter, postcard, telegram or other document or any parcel or thing in the custody 

of the postal or telegraph authority. 

92. Procedure as to letters and telegrams.—(1) If any document, parcel or thing in the custody of a 
postal or telegraph authority is, in the opinion of the District Magistrate, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Court 
of Session or High Court wanted for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding 
under this Code, such Magistrate or Court may require the postal or telegraph authority, as the case may 
be, to deliver the document, parcel or thing to such person as the Magistrate or Court directs. 

(2)  If  any  such  document,  parcel  or  thing  is,  in  the  opinion  of  any  other  Magistrate,  whether 
Executive or Judicial, or of any Commissioner of Police or District Superintendent of Police, wanted for 
any such purpose, he may require the postal or telegraph authority, as the case may be, to cause search to 
be made for and to detain such document, parcel or thing pending the order of a District Magistrate, Chief 
Judicial Magistrate or Court under sub-section (1). 

93.  When  search-warrant  may  be  issued.—(1)  (a)  Where  any  Court  has  reason  to  believe  that  a 
person to whom a summons order under section 91 or a requisition under sub-section (1) of section 92 has 

B.—Search-warrants 

52 

 

been, or might be, addressed, will not or would not produce the document or thing as required by such 
summons or requisition, or 

(b) where such document or thing is not known to the Court to be in the possession of any person, or 

 (c) where the Court considers that the purposes of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this 
Code will be served by a  general search or inspection, it may issue a search-warrant; and the person to 
whom  such  warrant  is  directed,  may  search  or  inspect  in  accordance  therewith  and  the  provisions 
hereinafter contained. 

(2) The Court may, if it thinks fit, specify in the warrant the particular place or part thereof to which 
only  the  search  or  inspection  shall  extend;  and  the  person  charged  with  the  execution  of  such  warrant 
shall then search or inspect only the place or part so specified. 

(3) Nothing contained in this section shall authorise any Magistrate other than a District Magistrate or 
Chief Judicial Magistrate to grant a warrant to search for a document, parcel or other thing in the custody 
of the postal or telegraph authority. 

94. Search of place suspected to contain stolen property, forged documents, etc.—(1) If a District 
Magistrate,  Sub-divisional  Magistrate  or  Magistrate  of  the  first  class,  upon  information  and  after  such 
inquiry as he thinks necessary, has reason to believe that any place is used for the deposit or sale of stolen 
property, or for the deposit, sale or production of any objectionable article to which this section applies, or 
that  any  such  objectionable  article  is  deposited  in  any  place,  he  may  by  warrant  authorise  any  police 
officer above the rank of a constable— 

(a) to enter, with such assistance as may be required, such place, 

(b) to search the same in the manner specified in the warrant, 

(c) to take possession of any property or article therein found which he reasonably suspects to be 

stolen property or objectionable article to which this section applies, 

(d) to convey such property or article before a Magistrate, or to guard the same on the spot until 

the offender is taken before a Magistrate, or otherwise to dispose of it in some place of safety, 

(e)  to  take  into  custody  and  carry  before  a  Magistrate  every  person  found  in  such  place  who 
appears to have been privy to the deposit, sale or production of any such property or article knowing 
or having reasonable cause to suspect it to be stolen property or,  as the case may be, objectionable 
article to which this section applies. 

(2) The objectionable articles to which this section applies are— 

(a) counterfeit coin; 

(b) pieces of metal made in contravention of the Metal Tokens Act, 1889 (1 of 1889), or brought 
into  India  in  contravention  of  any  notification  for  the  time  being  in  force  under  section  11  of  the 
Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962);

same.—(1) Where— 

(a) any newspaper, or book, or 

(b) any document, 

wherever  printed,  appears  to  the  State  Government  to  contain  any  matter  the  publication  of  which  is 

53 

 

punishable under section 124A or section 153A or section 153B or section 292 or section 293 or section 
295A  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860),  the  State  Government  may,  by  notification,  stating  the 
grounds of its opinion, declare  every    copy    of    the  issue  of  the  newspaper  containing  such  matter, 
and  every  copy  of  such  book  or  other  document  to  be  forfeited  to  Government,  and  thereupon  any 
police officer may seize the same wherever found in India and any Magistrate may by warrant authorise 
any  police  officer  not  below  the  rank  of  sub-inspector  to  enter  upon  and  search  for  the  same  in  any 
premises where any copy of such issue, or any such book or other document may be or may be reasonably 
suspected to be. 

(2) In this section and in section 96,— 

Act, 1867 (25 of 1867); 

(a)  “newspaper”  and  “book”  have  the  same  meaning  as  in  the  Press  and  Registration  of  Books 

(b) “document” includes any painting, drawing or photograph, or other visible representation. 

(3)  No  order  passed  or  action  taken  under  this  section  shall  be  called  in  question  in  any  Court 

otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of section 96. 

96. Application to High Court to set aside declaration of forfeiture.—(1) Any person having any 
interest  in  any  newspaper,  book  or  other  document,  in  respect  of  which  a  declaration  of  forfeiture  has 
been made under section 95, may, within two months from the date of publication in the Official Gazette 
of such declaration, apply to the High Court to set aside such declaration on the ground that the issue of 
the  newspaper,  or  the  book  or  other  document,  in  respect  of  which  the  declaration  was  made,  did  not 
contain any such matter as is referred to in sub-section (1) of section 95. 

(2) Every such application shall, where the High Court consists of three or more Judges, be heard and 
determined by a Special Bench of the High Court composed of three Judges and where the High Court 
consists of less than three Judges, such Special Bench shall be composed of all the Judges of that High 
Court. 

(3)  On  the  hearing  of  any  such  application  with  reference  to  any  newspaper,  any  copy  of  such 
newspaper may be given in evidence in aid of the proof of the nature or tendency of the words, signs or 
visible representations contained in such newspaper, in respect of which the declaration of forfeiture was 
made. 

(4) The  High  Court  shall, if  it  is  not  satisfied  that the  issue  of  the  newspaper,  or  the  book  or  other 
document, in respect of which the application has been made, contained any such matter as is referred to 
in sub-section (1) of section 95, set aside the declaration of forfeiture. 

(5) Where there is a difference of opinion among the Judges forming the Special Bench, the decision 

shall be in accordance with the opinion of the majority of those Judges. 

97. Search for persons wrongfully confined.—If any District Magistrate, Sub-divisional Magistrate 
or Magistrate of the first class has reason to believe that any person is confined under such circumstances 
that the confinement amounts to an offence, he may issue a search-warrant, and the person to whom such 
warrant is directed may search for the person so confined; and such search shall be made in accordance 
therewith, and the person, if found, shall be immediately taken before a Magistrate, who shall make such 
order as in the circumstances of the case seems proper. 

98.  Power  to  compel  restoration  of  abducted  females.—Upon  complaint  made  on  oath  of  the 
abduction  or  unlawful  detention  of  a  woman,  or a female  child under the  age  of  eighteen  years  for any 
unlawful  purpose,  a  District  Magistrate,  Sub-divisional  Magistrate  or  Magistrate  of  the  first  class  may 
make an order for the immediate restoration of such woman to her liberty, or of such female child to her 
husband,    parent,    guardian  or  other  person  having  the  lawful  charge  of  such  child,  and  may  compel 
compliance with such order, using such force as may be necessary. 

C.—General provisions relating to searches 

99. Direction, etc., of search-warrants.—The provisions of sections 38, 70, 72, 74, 77, 78 and 79 
shall,  so  far  as  may  be,  apply  to  all  search-warrants  issued  under  section  93,  section  94,  section  95  or 

54 

 

section 97. 

100. Persons in charge of closed place to allow search.—(1) Whenever any place liable to search or 
inspection under this Chapter is closed, any person  residing in, or being in charge of, such place, shall, on 
demand of the officer or other person executing the warrant, and on production of the warrant, allow him 
free ingress thereto, and afford all reasonable facilities  for a search therein. 

(2)  If ingress into such place cannot be so obtained, the officer or other person executing the warrant 

may proceed in the manner provided by sub-section (2) of section 47.  

(3)  Where any person in or about such place is reasonably suspected of concealing about his person 
any  article  for  which  search  should  be  made,  such  person  may    be  searched  and  if  such  person  is  a 
woman, the search  shall be made by another woman with strict regard to decency.  

(4) Before making a search under this Chapter, the officer or other person about to make it shall call 
upon  two  or  more  independent  and  respectable  inhabitants  of  the  locality  in  which  the  place  to  be 
searched  is  situate  or  of  any  other  locality  if  no  such  inhabitant  of  the  said  locality  is  available  or  is 
willing to be a witness to the search, to attend and witness the search and may issue an order in writing to 
them or any of them so to do. 

(5)  The  search  shall  be  made  in  their  presence,  and  a  list  of  all  things  seized  in  the  course  of  such 
search and of the places in which they are respectively found shall be prepared by such officer or other 
person  and  signed  by  such  witnesses;  but  no  person  witnessing  a  search  under  this  section  shall  be 
required to attend the Court as a witness of the search unless specially summoned by it. 

(6)  The  occupant  of  the  place  searched,  or  some  person  in  his  behalf,  shall,  in  every  instance,  be 
permitted to attend during the search, and a copy of the list prepared under this section, signed by the said 
witnesses, shall be delivered to such occupant or person. 

(7) When any person is searched under sub-section (3), a list of all things taken possession of shall be 

prepared, and a copy thereof shall be delivered to such person. 

(8)  Any  person  who,  without  reasonable  cause,  refuses  or  neglects  to  attend  and  witness  a  search 
under this section, when called upon to do so by an order in writing delivered or tendered to him, shall be 
deemed to have committed an offence under section 187 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). 

101.  Disposal  of  things  found  in  search  beyond  jurisdiction.—When,  in  the  execution  of  a            

search-warrant at any place beyond the local jurisdiction of the Court which issued the same, any of the 
things for which search is made, are found, such things, together with the list of the same prepared under 
the  provisions  hereinafter  contained,  shall  be  immediately  taken  before  the  Court  issuing  the  warrant, 
unless such place is nearer to the Magistrate having jurisdiction therein than to such Court, in which case 
the list and things shall be immediately taken before such Magistrate; and, unless there be good cause to 
the contrary, such Magistrate shall make an order authorising them to be taken to such Court. 

102.  Power  of  police  officer  to  seize  certain  property.—(1)  Any  police  officer  may  seize  any 
property  which  may  be  alleged  or  suspected  to  have  been  stolen,  or  which  may  be  found  under 
circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any offence. 

(2) Such police officer, if subordinate to the officer in charge of a police station, shall forthwith report 

the seizure to that officer. 

 

D.—Miscellaneous 

55 

 

1[(3)  Every  police  officer  acting  under  sub-section  (1)  shall  forthwith  report  the  seizure  to  the 
Magistrate  having  jurisdiction  and  where  the  property  seized  is  such  that  it  cannot  be  conveniently 
transported to the Court, 2[or where there is difficulty in securing proper accommodation for the custody 
of  such  property,  or  where  the  continued  retention  of  the  property  in  police  custody  may  not  be 
considered necessary for the purpose of investigation,] he may give custody thereof to any person on his 
executing a  bond  undertaking  to produce the property before the Court as and when required and to give 
effect to the further orders of the Court as to the disposal of the same:] 

3[Provided that where the property seized under sub-section (1) is subject to speedy and natural decay 
and if the person entitled to the possession of such property is unknown or absent and the value of such 
property  is  less  than  five  hundred  rupees,  it  may  forthwith  be  sold  by  auction  under  the  orders  of  the 
Superintendent  of  Police  and  the  provisions  of  sections  457  and  458  shall,  as  nearly  as  may  be 
practicable, apply to the net proceeds of such sale.]

available before it. 

(2) Where the Court is satisfied that some of the properties referred to in the show -cause notice 
are  proceeds  of  crime  but  it  is  not  possible  to  identify  specifically  such  properties,  then,  it  shall  be 
lawful for the Court to specify the properties which, to the best of its judgment, are proceeds of crime

section (1) of section 105E or the issue of a notice under section 105G, any property referred to in the

of  the  public  tranquillity  or  the  commission  of  any  offence  or  for  the  public  safety,  may,  for  reasons  to  be 
recorded in writing, direct the person in respect of whom the order under section 111 has been made to execute a

118.  Discharge  of  person  informed  against.—If,  on  an  inquiry  under  section  116,  it  is  not  proved  that  it  is 
necessary  for  keeping  the  peace  or  maintaining  good  behaviour,  as  the  case  may  be,  that  the  person  in  respect  of 
whom the inquiry is made, should execute a bond, the  Magistrate shall make an entry on the record to that effect, 
and if such person is in custody only for the purposes of the inquiry, shall release him, or, if such person is not in 
custody, shall discharge him.

119.  Commencement  of  period  for  which  security  is  required.—(1)  If  any  person,  in  respect  of  whom  an 
order requiring security is made under section 106 or section 117, is at the time such order is made, sentenced to, or 
undergoing  a  sentence  of,  imprisonment,  the  period  for  which  such  security  is  required  shall  commence  on  the 
expiration of such sentence. 

(2)  In  other  cases  such  period  shall  commence  on  the  date  of  such  order  unless  the  Magistrate,  for  sufficient 

reason, fixes a later date. 

120. Contents of bond.—The bond to be executed by any such person shall bind him to keep the peace or to be 
of good behaviour, as the case may be, and in the latter case the commission or attempt to commit, or the abetment 
of, any offence punishable with imprisonment, wherever it may be committed, is a breach of the bond. 

121.  Power to  reject  sureties.—(1)  A  Magistrate  may  refuse  to  accept  any  surety  offered,  or  may  reject  any 
surety previously accepted by him or his predecessor under this Chapter on the ground that such surety is an unfit 
person for the purposes of the bond: 

Provided that, before so refusing to accept or rejecting any such surety, he shall either himself hold an inquiry 
on  oath  into  the  fitness  of  the  surety,  or  cause  such  inquiry  to  be  held  and  a  report  to  be  made  thereon  by  a 
Magistrate subordinate to him. 

(2) Such Magistrate shall, before holding the inquiry, give reasonable notice to the surety and to the person by 
whom the surety was offered and shall, in making the inquiry, record the substance of the evidence adduced before 
him. 

(3)  If  the  Magistrate  is  satisfied,  after  considering  the  evidence  so  adduced  either  before  him  or  before  a 
Magistrate deputed under sub-section (1), and the report of such Magistrate (if any), that the surety is an unfit person 
for the purposes of the bond, he shall make an order refusing to accept or rejecting, as the case may be, such surety 
and recording his reasons for so doing: 

Provided  that,  before  making  an  order  rejecting  any  surety  who  has  previously  been  accepted,  the  Magistrate 
shall issue his summons or warrant, as he thinks fit, and cause the person for whom the surety is bound to appear or 
to be brought before him. 

122. Imprisonment in default of security.—(1) (a) If any person ordered to give security under section 106 or 
section 117 does not give such security on or before the date on which the period for which such security is to be 
given  commences,  he  shall,  except  in  the  case  next  hereinafter  mentioned,  be  committed  to  prison,  or,  if  he  is 
already in prison, be detained in prison until such period expires or until within such period he gives the security to 
the Court or Magistrate who made the order requiring it. 

(b) If any person after having executed a 1[bond, with or without sureties] without sureties for keeping the peace 
in pursuance of an order of a  Magistrate under section 117, is proved, to the satisfaction of such Magistrate or his 
successor-in-office,  to  have  committed  breach  of  the  bond,  such  Magistrate  or  successor-in-office  may,  after 
recording the grounds of such proof, order that the person be arrested and detained in prison until the expiry of the 
period of the bond and such order shall be without prejudice to any other punishment or forfeiture to which the said 
person may be liable in accordance with law. 

(2) When such person has been ordered by a Magistrate to give security for a period exceeding one year, such 
Magistrate shall, if such person does not give such security as aforesaid, issue a warrant directing him to be detained 
in prison pending the orders of the Sessions Judge and the proceedings shall be laid, as soon as conveniently may be, 
before such Court. 

(3) Such Court, after examining such proceedings and requiring from the Magistrate any further information or 
evidence which it thinks necessary, and after giving the concerned person a reasonable opportunity of being heard, 
may pass such order on the case as it thinks fit: 

Provided that the period (if any) for which any person is imprisoned for failure to give security shall not exceed

64 

 

three years. 

(4)  If  security  has  been  required  in  the  course  of  the  same  proceeding  from  two  or  more  persons  in  respect                 

of any one of  whom the proceedings are referred to the Sessions Judge under sub-section (2) such reference  shall 
also  include  the  case  of  any  other  of  such  persons  who  has  been  order  to  give  security,  and  the  provisions  of                  
sub-sections  (2)  and  (3)  shall,  in  that  event,  apply  to  the  case  of  such  other  person  also,  except  that  the  period  (if 
any) for which he may be imprisoned, shall not exceed the period for which he was ordered to give security. 

(5)  A  Sessions  Judge  may  in  his  discretion  transfer  any  proceedings  laid  before  him  under  sub-section  (2)  or 
sub-section (4) to an Additional Sessions Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge and upon such transfer, such Additional 
Sessions  Judge  or  Assistant  Sessions  Judge  may  exercise  the  powers  of  a  Sessions  Judge  under  this  section  in 
respect of such proceedings. 

(6) If the security is tendered to the officer in charge of the jail, he shall forthwith refer the matter  to the Court 

or Magistrate who made the order, and shall await the orders of such Court or Magistrate. 

(7) Imprisonment for failure to give security for keeping the peace shall be simple. 

(8) Imprisonment for failure to give security for good behaviour shall, where the proceedings have been taken 
under  section  108,  be  simple,  and,  where  the  proceedings  have  been  taken  under  section  109  or  section  110,  be 
rigorous or simple as the Court or Magistrate in each case directs. 

123.  Power  to  release  persons  imprisoned  for  failing  to  give  security.—(1)  Whenever  1[the  District 
Magistrate  in  the  case  of  an  order  passed  by  an  Executive  Magistrate  under  section  117,  or  the  Chief  Judicial 
Magistrate in any other case] is of opinion that any person imprisoned for failing to give security under this Chapter 
may  be  released  without  hazard  to  the  community  or  to  any  other  person,  he  may  order  such  person  to  be 
discharged. 

(2) Whenever any person has been imprisoned for failing to give security under this Chapter, the High Court or 
Court  of  Session,  or,  where  the  order  was  made  by  any  other  Court,  2[District  Magistrate,  in  the  case  of  an  order 
passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other case], may make 
an  order  reducing  the  amount  of  the  security  or  the  number  of  sureties  or  the  time  for  which  security  has  been 
required. 

(3) An order under  sub-section (1)  may direct the discharge of  such person either  without conditions or upon 

any conditions which such person accepts: 

ordered to give security has expired. 

Provided  that  any  condition  imposed  shall  cease  to  be  operative  when  the  period  for  which  such  person  was 

(4) The State Government may prescribe the conditions upon which a conditional discharge may be made. 

(5) If any condition upon which any person has been discharged is, in the opinion of 2[District Magistrate, in the 
case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other 
case] by whom the order of discharge was made or of his successor, not fulfilled, he may cancel the same. 

(6)  When  a  conditional  order  of  discharge  has  been  cancelled  under  sub-section  (5),  such  person  may  be 
arrested by any police officer without warrant, and shall thereupon be produced before the  3[District Magistrate, in 
the case of an order passed by an Executive Magistrate  under section 117, or the Chief  Judicial Magistrate in any 
other case]. 

(7)  Unless  such  person  gives  security  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  original  order  for  the  unexpired 
portion of the term for which he was in the first instance committed  or ordered to be detained (such portion being 
deemed to be a period equal to the period between the date of the breach of the conditions of discharge and the date 
on which, except for such conditional discharge, he would have been entitled to release), 1[District Magistrate, in the

case of an order  passed by an Executive Magistrate under section 117, or the Chief Judicial Magistrate in any other 
case] may remand such person to prison to undergo such unexpired portion. 

(8)  A  person  remanded  to  prison  under  sub-section  (7)  shall,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  section  122,  be 
released at any time on giving security in accordance with the terms of the original order for the unexpired portion 
aforesaid to the Court or Magistrate by whom such order was made, or to its or his successor. 

(9) The High Court or Court of Session may at any time, for sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing, cancel 
any  bond  for  keeping  the  peace  or  for  good  behaviour  executed  under  this  Chapter  by  any  order  made  by  it,  and 
1[District  Magistrate,  in  the  case  of  an  order  passed  by  an  Executive  Magistrate  under  section  117,  or  the  Chief 
Judicial Magistrate in any other case] may make such cancellation where such bond was executed under his order or 
under the order of any other Court in his district. 

(10) Any surety for the peaceable conduct or good behaviour of another person ordered to execute a bond under 
this Chapter may at any time apply to the Court making such order to cancel the bond and on such application being 
made, the Court shall issue a summons or warrant, as it thinks fit, requiring the person for whom such surety is bond 
appear or to be brought before it. 

124. Security for unexpired period of bond.—(1) When a person for whose appearance a summons or warrant 
has been issued under the proviso to sub-section (3) of section 121 or under sub-section (10) of section 123, appears 
or is brought before the Magistrate or Court, the Magistrate or Court shall cancel the bond executed by such person 
and shall order such person to give, for the unexpired portion of the term of such bond, fresh security of the same 
description as the original security. 

(2) Every such order shall, for the purposes of sections 120 to 123 (both inclusive) be deemed to be an order 

made under section 106 or section 117, as the case may be. 

CHAPTER IX

125.  Order  for  maintenance  of  wives,  children  and  parents.—(1)  If  any  person  having  sufficient  means 

neglects or refuses to maintain— 

(a) his wife, unable to maintain herself, or 

(b) his legitimate or illegitimate minor child, whether married or not, unable to maintain itself, or 

(c) his legitimate or illegitimate child (not being a married daughter) who has attained majority, where such 

child is, by reason of any physical or mental abnormality or injury unable to maintain itself, or 

(d) his father or mother, unable to maintain himself or herself, 

a  Magistrate  of  the  first  class  may,  upon  proof  of  such  neglect  or  refusal,  order  such  person  to  make  a  monthly 
allowance  for  the  maintenance  of  his  wife  or  such  child,  father  or  mother,  at  such  monthly  rate  1***  as  such 
Magistrate thinks fit and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time direct: 

Provided that the Magistrate may order the father of a minor female child referred to in clause (b) to make such 
allowance, until she attains her majority, if the Magistrate is satisfied that the husband of such minor female child, if 
married, is not possessed of sufficient means: 

2[Provided further that the Magistrate may, during the pendency of the proceeding regarding monthly allowance 
for  the  maintenance  under  this  sub-section,  order  such  person  to  make  a  monthly  allowance  for  the  interim 
maintenance of his wife or such child, father or mother, and the expenses of such proceeding which the Magistrate 
considers reasonable, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time direct: 

                                                 
1. Certain words omitted by Act 50 of  2001, s. 2  (w.e.f. 24-9-2001).

Provided  also  that  an  application  for  the  monthly  allowance  for  the  interim  maintenance  and  expenses  of 
proceeding under the second proviso shall, as far as possible, be disposed of within sixty days from the date of the 
service of notice of the application to such person.] 

Explanation.—For the purposes of this Chapter,— 

(a)  “minor”  means  a  person  who,  under  the  provisions  of  the  Indian  Majority  Act,  1875  (9  of  1875)  is 

deemed not to have attained his majority; 

(b) “wife” includes a woman who has been divorced by, or has obtained a divorce from, her husband and 

has not remarried. 

1[(2)  Any  such  allowance  for  the  maintenance  or  interim  maintenance  and  expenses  of  proceeding  shall  be 
payable  from  the  date  of  the  order,  or,  if  so  ordered,  from  the  date  of  the  application  for  maintenance  or  interim 
maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be.] 

(3) If any person so ordered fails without sufficient cause to comply with the order, any such Magistrate may, for 
every breach of the order, issue a warrant for levying the amount due in the manner provided for levying fines, and 
may sentence such person, for the whole or any part of each month’s  2[allowance for the maintenance or the interim 
maintenance and expenses of proceeding, as the case may be,] remaining unpaid after the execution of the warrant, 
to imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or until payment if sooner made: 

Provided that no warrant shall be issued for the recovery of any amount due under this section unless application 

be made to the Court to levy such amount within a period of one year from the date on which it became due: 

Provided  further  that  if  such  person  offers  to  maintain  his  wife  on  condition  of  her  living  with  him,  and  she 

refuses to live with him, such Magistrate may consider any grounds of refusal stated by her, and may make an order 

under this section notwithstanding such offer, if he is satisfied that there is just ground for so doing. 

Explanation.—If  a  husband  has  contracted  marriage  with  another  woman  or  keeps  a  mistress,  it  shall  be 

considered to be just ground for his wife’s refusal to live with him. 

(4)  No  wife  shall  be  entitled  to  receive  an  3[allowance  for  the  maintenance  or  the  interim  maintenance  and 
expenses of proceeding, as the case may be,] from her husband under this section  if she is living in adultery, or if,

assistance  of  any  male  person,  not  being  an  officer  or  member  of  the  armed  forces  and  acting  as  such,  for  the 

purpose of dispersing such assembly, and, if necessary, arresting and confining the persons who form part of it, in

disperse the assembly or to have them punished according to law. 

(3) Every such officer of the armed forces shall obey such requisition in such manner as he thinks fit, but in so 

doing he shall use as little force, and do as little injury to person and property, as may be consistent with dispersing 

the assembly and arresting and detaining such persons.

endangered  by  any  such  assembly  and  no  Executive  Magistrate  can  be  communicated  with,  any  commissioned  or 

gazetted  officer  of  the  armed  forces  may  disperse  such  assembly  with  the  help  of  the  armed  forces  under  his 

command, and may arrest and confine any persons forming part of it, in order to disperse such assembly or that they 

may  be  punished  according  to  law;  but  if,  while  he  is  acting  under  this  section,  it  becomes  practicable  for  him  to

consequence the removal, repair or support of such building, tent or structure, or the removal or support of such 
tree, is necessary; or

the purpose of preventing obstruction, nuisance or danger to the public in the use of any way, river, channel or place, 
the Magistrate shall, on the appearance before him of the person against whom the order was made, question him as 
to whether he denies the existence of  any public right in respect of the way, river, channel or place, and if he does 
so, the Magistrate shall, before proceeding under section 138, inquire into the matter.  

(2) If in such inquiry the Magistrate finds that there is any reliable evidence in support of such denial, he shall 

stay the proceedings until the matter of the existence of such right has been decided by a competent Court; and, if he 

finds that there is no such evidence, he shall proceed as laid down in section 138.

may be, with such modification. 

(3) If the Magistrate is not so satisfied, no further proceedings shall be taken in the case.

recover the costs of performing it, either by the sale of any building, goods or other property removed by his order, 

or by the  distress and sale of any other movable property of such person within or without such Magistrate’s local 

jurisdiction, and if such other property is without such jurisdiction, the order shall authorise its attachment and sale

the  opinion  of  a  District  Magistrate,  a  Sub-divisional  Magistrate  or  any  other  Executive  Magistrate  specially 

empowered  by the State Government in this behalf, there is sufficient ground for proceeding under this section 

and immediate prevention  or speedy remedy is desirable, such Magistrate may, by a written order stating the 

material facts of the case and served in the manner provided by section 134, direct any person to abstain from a 

certain act or to take certain order with respect to certain property in his possession or under his management, 

if such Magistrate considers that such direction is likely to prevent, or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance 

or  injury  to  any  person  lawfully  employed,  or  danger  to  human  life,  health  o r  safety  or  a  disturbance  of  the 

public tranquillity, or a riot, or an affray.  

(2)  An  order  under  this  section  may,  in  cases  of  emergency  or  in  cases  where  the  circumstances  do  not

predecessor-in-office. 

(6)  The  State  Government  may,  either  on  its  own  motion  or  on  the  application  of  any  person  aggrieved, 

rescind or alter any order made by it under the proviso to sub -section (4). 

(7) Where an application under sub-section (5) or sub-section (6) is received, the Magistrate, or the State 
Government, as the case may be, shall afford to the applicant an early opportunity of appearing before him or 
it,  either  in  person  or  by  pleader  and  showing  cause  against  the  order;  and  if  the  Mag istrate  or  the  State

peace  or  public  safety  or  for  the  maintenance  of  public  order,  by  notification,  direct  that  a  public 
notice  issued  or  order  made  by  the  District  Magistrate  under  this  section  shall  remain   in  force  for 
such further period not exceeding six months from the date on which such public notice or order was 
issued  or  made  by  the  District  Magistrate  would  have,  but  for  such  direction,  expired,  as  it  may 
specify in the said notification.

Magistrate. 

Explanation.—The  word  “arms”  shall  have  the  meaning  assigned  to  it  in  section  153AA  of  the

D.—Disputes as to immovable property 

145. Procedure where dispute concerning land or water is likely to cause breach of peace .—
(1)  Whenever  an  Executive  Magistrate  is  satisfied  from  a  report  of  a  polic e  officer  or  upon  other 
information that a dispute likely to cause a breach of the peace exists concerning any land or water or 
the  boundaries  thereof,  within  his  local  jurisdiction,  he  shall  make  an  order  in  writing,  stating  the 
grounds  of  his  being  so  satisfied,  and  requiring  the  parties  concerned  in  such  dispute  to  attend  his 
Court in person or by pleader, on a specified date and time, and to put in written statements of their 
respective claims as respects the fact of actual possession of the subject of  dispute. 

(2)  For  the  purposes of this section, the  expression  “land  or  water” includes buildings,  markets, 

fisheries, crops or other produce of land, and the rents or profits of any such property.  

(3) A copy of the order shall be served in the manner provided by this Code for the service of a 
summons  upon  such  person  or  persons  as  the  Magistrate  may  direct,  and  at  least  one  copy  shall  be 
published by being affixed to some conspicuous place at or near the subject of dispute.  

(4) The Magistrate  shall  then, without reference to the merits or the claims of any of the parties 
to a right to possess the subject of dispute, persue the statements so put in, hear the parties, receive 
all  such  evidence  as  may  be  produced  by  them,  take  such  further  evidence,  if  any,  a s  he  thinks  
necessary, and, if possible, decide whether any and which of the parties was, at the date of the order 
made by him under sub-section (1), in possession of the subject of dispute: 

Provided  that  if  it  appears  to  the  Magistrate  that  any  party  has   been  forcibly  and  wrongfully 
dispossessed within two months next before the date on which the report of a police officer or other 
                                                 
1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 16 (date yet to be notified, see appendix)  

75 

 

information was received by the Magistrate, or after that date and before the date of his order under 
sub-section (1), he may treat the party so dispossessed as if that party had been in possession on the 
date of his order under sub-section (1). 

(5)  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  preclude  any  party  so  required  to  attend,  or  any  other  person 
interested, from showing that no such dispute as aforesaid exists or has existed; and in such case the 
Magistrate shall cancel his said order, and all further proceedings thereon shall be stayed, but, subject 
to such cancellation, the order of the Magistrate under sub-section (1) shall be final. 

(6) (a) If the Magistrate decides that one of the parties was, or should under the proviso to sub -
section  (4)  be  treated  as  being,  in  such  possession  of  the  said  subject,  he  shall  issue  an  order 
declaring such party to be entitled to possession thereof until evicted therefrom in due course of law, 
and  forbidding  all  disturbance  of  such  possession  until  such  eviction;  and  when  he  proceeds  under 
the  proviso  to  sub-section   (4),  may  restore  to  possession  the  party  forcibly  and  wrongfully 
dispossessed. 

(b) The order made under this sub-section shall be served and published in the manner laid down 

in sub-section (3). 

(7)  When  any  party  to  any  such  proceeding  dies,  the  Magistrate  may  cause  the  legal 
representative  of  the  deceased  party  to  be  made  a  party  to  the  proceeding  and  shall  thereupon 
continue the inquiry, and if any question arises as to who the legal representative of a deceased party 
for  the  purposes  of  such  proceeding  is,  all  persons  claiming  to  be  representatives  of  the  deceased 
party shall be made parties thereto. 

(8) If the Magistrate is of opinion that any crop or other produce of the property, the subject of dispute in a 
proceeding  under  this  section  pending  before  him,  is  subject  to  speedy  and  natural  decay,  he  may  make  an 
order for the proper custody or sale of such property, and, upon the completion of the inquiry, shall make such 
order for the disposal of such property, or the sale-proceeds thereof, as he thinks fit. 

(9) The Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, at any stage of the proceedings under  this section, on the 
application  of  either  party,  issue  a  summons  to any witness directing him to attend or to produce any 
document or thing. 

(10)  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  deemed  to  be  in  derogation  of  powers  of  the  Magistrate  to 

proceed under section 107. 

146. Power to attach subject of dispute and to appoint receiver.—(1) If the Magistrate at any time 
after making the order under sub-section (1) of section 145 considers the case to be one of emergency, or 
if he decides that none of the parties was then in such possession as is referred to in section 145, or if he is 
unable  to satisfy  himself  as  to  which  of  them  was  then  in  such  possession  of the  subject  of dispute,  he 
may attach the subject of dispute until a competent Court has determined the rights of the parties thereto 
with regard to the person entitled to the possession thereof: 

Provided that such Magistrate may withdraw the attachment at any time if he is satisfied that there is 

no longer any likelihood of breach of the peace with regard to the subject of dispute. 

(2)  When  the  Magistrate  attaches  the  subject  of  dispute,  he  may,  if  no  receiver  in  relation  to  such 
subject of dispute has been appointed by any Civil Court, make such arrangements as he considers proper 
for looking after the property or if he thinks fit, appoint a receiver thereof, who shall have, subject to the 
control of the Magistrate, all the powers of a receiver appointed under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(5 of 1908): 

Provided  that  in  the  event  of  a  receiver  being  subsequently  appointed  in  relation  to  the  subject  of 

dispute by any Civil Court, the Magistrate— 

(a) shall order the receiver appointed by him to hand over the possession of the subject of dispute 
to the receiver appointed by the Civil Court and shall thereafter discharge the receiver appointed by 
him; 

(b) may make such other incidental or consequential orders as may be just. 

147. Dispute concerning right of use of land or water.—(1) Whenever an Executive Magistrate is 

76 

 

satisfied  from  the  report  of  a  police  officer  or  upon  other  information,  that  a  dispute  likely  to  cause  a 
breach  of  the  peace  exists  regarding  any  alleged  right  of  user  of  any  land  or  water  within  his  local 
jurisdiction,  whether  such  right  be  claimed  as  an  easement  or  otherwise,  he  shall    make    an    order  in 
writing,    stating    the    grounds    of    his    being  so  satisfied  and  requiring  the  parties  concerned  in  such 
dispute  to  attend  his  Court  in  person  or  by  pleader  on  a  specified  date  and  time  and  to  put  in  written 
statements of their respective claims. 

Explanation.—The  expression  “land  or  water”  has  the  meaning  given  to  it  in  sub-section  (2)  of 

section 145. 

(2)  The  Magistrate  shall  then  persue  the  statements  so  put  in,  hear  the  parties,  receive  all  such 
evidence as may be produced by them respectively, consider the effect of such evidence, take such further 
evidence,  if  any,  as  he  thinks  necessary  and,  if  possible,  decide  whether  such  right  exists;  and  the 
provisions of section 145 shall, so far as may be, apply in the case of such inquiry. 

(3)  If  it  appears  to  such  Magistrate  that  such  rights  exist,  he  may  make  an  order  prohibiting  any 
interference with the exercise of such right, including, in a proper case, an order for the removal of any 
obstruction in the exercise of any such right: 

Provided  that  no  such  order  shall  be  made  where  the  right  is  exercisable  at  all  times  of  the  year, 
unless such right has been exercised within three months next before the receipt under sub-section (1) of 
the report of a  police  officer  or  other  information  leading  to the institution of the  inquiry,  or  where the 
right  is  exercisable  only  at  particular  seasons  or  on  particular  occasions,  unless  the  right  has  been 
exercised during the last of such seasons or on the last of such occasions before such receipt. 

(4) When in any proceedings commenced under sub-section (1) of section 145 the Magistrate finds 
that the dispute is as regards an alleged right of user of land or water, he may, after recording his reasons, 
continue with the proceedings as if they had been commenced under sub-section (1), 
and  when  in  any  proceedings  commenced  under  sub-section  (1)  the  magistrate  finds  that  the  dispute 
should be dealt with under section 145, he may, after recording his reasons, continue with the proceedings 
as if they had been commenced under sub-section (1) of section 145.

into  any  offence  which  he  is  authorised  to  investigate  may  be  found  in  any  place  within  the  limits  of  the  police

making any  investigation under this  Chapter to search, or cause to be searched, any  place in the limits of another 
police station in accordance  with the provisions of section 165, as if such place  were  within the limits of  his own

(a) where it appears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of is triable exclusively by the 

Court of Session; or 

 (b) where the complaint has not been made by a Court, unless the complainant and the witnesses 

present (if any) have been examined on oath under section 200. 

(2) In an inquiry under sub-section (1), the Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, take evidence of witnesses 

on oath: 

Provided that if it appears to the Magistrate that the offence complained of is triable exclusively by 
the Court of Session, he shall call upon the complainant to produce all his witnesses and examine them on 
oath. 

(3) If an investigation under sub-section (1) is made by a person not being a police officer, he shall 
have for that investigation all the powers conferred by this Code on an officer in charge of a police station 
except the power to arrest without warrant. 

203.  Dismissal  of  complaint.—If,  after  considering  the  statements  on  oath  (if  any)  of  the 
complainant and of the witnesses and the result of the inquiry or investigation (if any) under section 202, 
the  Magistrate  is  of  opinion  that  there  is  no  sufficient  ground  for  proceeding,  he  shall  dismiss  the 
complaint, and in every such case he shall briefly record his reasons for so doing. 

 

CHAPTER XVI 

COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE MAGISTRATES 

204. Issue of process.—(1) If in the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence there is 

sufficient ground for proceeding, and the case appears to be— 

(a) a summons-case, he shall issue his summons for the attendance of the accused, or 

(b) a warrant-case, he may issue a warrant, or, if he thinks fit, a summons, for causing the accused 
to  be  brought  or  to  appear  at  a  certain  time  before  such  Magistrate  or  (if  he  has  no  jurisdiction 
himself) some other Magistrate having jurisdiction. 

(2) No summons or warrant shall be issued against the accused under sub-section (1) until a list of the 

prosecution witnesses has been filed. 

                                                 
1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 19 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006). 

104 
 

(3)  In  a  proceeding  instituted  upon  a  complaint  made  in  writing,  every  summons  or  warrant  issued 

under sub-section (1) shall be accompanied by a copy of such complaint. 

(4) When by any law for the time being in force any process-fees or other fees are payable, no process 
shall  be  issued  until  the  fees  are  paid  and,  if  such  fees  are  not  paid  within  a  reasonable  time,  the 
Magistrate may dismiss the complaint. 

(5) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the provisions of section 87. 

205. Magistrate may dispense with personal attendance of accused.—(1) Whenever a Magistrate 
issues  a  summons,  he  may,  if  he  sees  reason  so  to  do,  dispense  with  the  personal  attendance  of  the 
accused and permit him to appear by his pleader. 

 (2)  But  the  Magistrate  inquiring  into  or  trying  the  case  may,  in  his  discretion,  at  any  stage  of  the 
proceedings, direct the personal attendance of the accused, and, if necessary, enforce such attendance in 
the manner hereinbefore provided. 

206.  Special  summons  in  cases  of  petty  offence.—(1)  If,  in  the  opinion  of  a  Magistrate  taking 
cognizance of a petty offence, the case may be summarily disposed of under section 260 1[or section 261], 
the Magistrate shall, except where he is, for reasons to be recorded in writing of a contrary opinion, issue 
summons to the accused requiring him either to appear in person or by pleader before the Magistrate on a 
specified date, or if he desires to plead guilty to the charge without appearing before the Magistrate, to 
transmit before the specified date, by post or by messenger to the Magistrate, the said plea in writing and 
the amount of fine specified in the summons or if he desires to appear by pleader and to plead guilty to 
the charge through such pleader, to authorise, in writing, the pleader to plead guilty to the charge on his 
behalf and to pay the fine through such pleader: 

Provided  that the amount  of  the  fine  specified  in  such  summons  shall  not  exceed  2[one  thousand 

rupees]. 

(2) For the purposes of this section, “petty offence” means any offence punishable only with fine 
not exceeding one thousand rupees, but does not include any offence so punishable under the Motor 
Vehicles  Act,  1939  (4  of 1939)3,  or under any  other  law  which  provides  for  convicting  the  accused 
person in his absence on a plea of guilty. 

4[(3) The  State  Government  may,  by  notification, specially  empower  any  Magistrate to exercise 
the  powers  conferred  by  sub-section  (1)  in  relation  to  any  offence  which  is  compoundable  under 
section 320 or any offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or 
with  fine,  or  with  both  where  the  Magistrate  is  of  opinion  that,  having  regard  to  the  facts  and 
circumstances of the case, the imposition of fine only would meet the ends of justice.] 

207. Supply to the accused of copy of police report and other documents.—In any case where 
the proceeding has been instituted on a police report, the Magistrate shall without delay furnish to the 
accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the following:— 

(i) the police report; 

(ii) the first information report recorded under section 154; 

(iii)  the  statements  recorded  under  sub-section  (3)  of  section  161  of  all  persons  whom  the 
prosecution  proposes  to  examine  as  its  witnesses,  excluding  therefrom  any  part  in  regard  to 
which a request for such exclusion has been made by the police officer under sub -section (6) of 

                                                 
1. Ins. by Act 25 of 2005, s. 20 (w.e.f. 23-6-2006). 
2. Subs. by,  s. 20, ibid.,  for “one hundred rupees” (w.e.f. 23-6-2006). 
3. Now the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (59 of 1988).  
4. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 18 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).  

105 
 

section 173; 

(iv) the confessions and statements, if any, recorded under section 164; 

(v) any other document or relevant extract thereof forwarded to the Magistrate with the police 

report under sub-section (5) of section 173: 
Provided that the Magistrate may, after perusing any such part of a statement as is referred to in            

clause  (iii) and considering the reasons given by the police officer for the request, direct that a copy 
of  that  part  of  the  statement  or  of  such  portion  thereof  as  the  Magistrate  thinks  proper,  shall  be 
furnished to the accused: 

Provided  further  that  if the  Magistrate is  satisfied that any  document refer red  to in clause  (v)  is 
voluminous, he shall, instead of furnishing the accused with a copy thereof, direct that he will only 
be allowed to inspect it either personally or through pleader in Court. 

208.  Supply  of  copies  of  statements  and  documents  to  accused  in  other  cases  triable  by 
Court  of  Session.—Where,  in  a  case  instituted  otherwise  than  on  a  police  report,  it  appears  to  the 
Magistrate  issuing  process  under  section  204  that  the  offence  is  triable  exclusively  by  the  Court  of 
Session, the Magistrate shall without delay furnish to the accused, free of cost, a copy of each of the 
following:— 

(i) the statements recorded under section 200 or section 202, of all persons examined by the 

Magistrate; 

(ii) the statements and confessions, if any, recorded under section 161 or section 164; 
(iii)  any  documents  produced  before  the  Magistrate  on  which  the  prosecution  proposes  to 

rely: 
Provided that if the Magistrate is satisfied that any such document is voluminous, he shall, instead 
of  furnishing  the  accused  with  a  copy  thereof,  direct  that  he  will  only  be  allowed  to  inspect  it  either 
personally or through pleader in Court. 

209. Commitment of case to Court of Session when offence is triable exclusively by it.—When in 
a case instituted on a police report or otherwise, the accused appears or is brought before the Magistrate 
and it appears to the Magistrate that the offence is triable exclusively by the Court of Session, he shall— 

1[(a) commit, after complying with the provisions of section 207 or section 208, as the case may 
be, the case to the Court of Session, and subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand 
the accused to custody until such commitment has been made;] 

(b) subject to the provisions of this Code relating to bail, remand the accused to custody during, 

and until the conclusion of, the trial; 

be produced in evidence; 

(c) send to that Court the record of the case and the documents and articles, if any, which are to 

(d) notify the Public Prosecutor of the commitment of the case to the Court of Session.

[Vide Gujarat Act 30 of 1976, s. 2] 
210. Procedure to be followed when there is a complaint case and police investigation in respect 
of  the  same  offence.—(1)  When  in  a  case  instituted  otherwise  than  on  a  police  report  (hereinafter 
referred to as a complaint case), it is made to appear to the Magistrate, during the course of the inquiry or 
trial held by him, that an investigation by the police is in progress in relation to the offence which is the 
subject-matter of the inquiry or trial held by him, the Magistrate shall stay the proceedings of such inquiry 
or trial and call for a report on the matter from the police officer conducting the investigation. 

(2)  If  a  report  is  made  by  the  investigating  police  officer  under  section  173  and  on  such  report 

                                                 
1. Subs. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 19, for clause (a) (w.e.f. 18-12-1978). 
106 
 

cognizance  of  any  offence  is  taken  by  the  Magistrate  against  any  person  who  is  an  accused  in  the 
complaint case, the Magistrate shall inquire into or try together the complaint case and the case arising out 
of the police report as if both the cases were instituted on a police report. 

(3) If the police report does not relate to any accused in the complaint case or if the Magistrate does 
not take cognizance of any offence on the police report, he shall proceed with the inquiry or trial, which 
was stayed by him, in accordance with the provisions of this Code. 

CHAPTER XVII 

THE CHARGE 

A.—Form of charges 

211. Contents of charge.—(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the 

accused is charged. 

the charge by that name only. 

 (2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in 

(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition 

of the offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. 

(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be 

mentioned in the charge. 

(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by 

law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case. 

(6) The charge shall be written in the language of the Court. 

(7)  If  the  accused,  having  been  previously  convicted  of  any  offence,  is  liable,  by  reason  of  such 
previous  conviction,  to  enhanced  punishment,  or  to  punishment  of  a  different  kind,  for  a  subsequent 
offence, and it is intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment 
which the Court may think fit to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous 
conviction shall be stated in the charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at 
any time before sentence is passed. 

Illustrations 

(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell within the definition of murder 
given in sections 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860); that it did not fall within any of the general exceptions 
of  the  said  Code;  and  that  it  did  not  fall  within  any  of  the  five  exceptions  to  section  300,  or  that,  if  it  did  fall  within 
Exception 1, one or other of the three provisos to that exception applied to it. 

(b) A is charged under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B 
by means of an instrument for shooting. This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335 
of the said Code, and that the general exceptions did not apply to it. 

(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or using a false property-mark. 
The charge may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or 
that he used a false property-mark, without reference to the definitions, of those crimes contained in the Indian Penal Code 
(45 of 1860); but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance be referred to in the charge. 

(d)  A  is  charged  under  section  184  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860)  with  intentionally  obstructing  a  sale  of 

property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words. 

212. Particulars as to time, place and person.—(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to 
the time and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom, or the thing (if any) in 

107 
 

respect of which, it was committed, as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter 
with which he is charged. 

(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of money 
or other movable property, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, describe 
the  movable  property  in  respect  of  which  the  offence  is  alleged  to  have  been  committed,  and  the  dates 
between which the offence is alleged to have been committed, without specifying particular items or exact 
dates,  and  the  charge  so  framed  shall  be  deemed  to  be  a  charge  of  one  offence  within  the  meaning  of 
section 219: 

Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed one year. 

213. When  manner of committing  offence must  be  stated.—When  the  nature  of the case  is  such 
that  the  particulars  mentioned  in  sections  211  and  212  do  not  give  the  accused  sufficient  notice  of  the 
matter with which he is charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the 
alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose. 

Illustrations 

(a) A is accused of the theft of a certain article at a certain time and place. The charge need not set out the manner in 

which the theft was effected. 

(b) A is accused of cheating B at a given time and place. The charge must set out the manner in which A cheated B. 

 (c)  A  is  accused  of  giving  false  evidence  at  a  given  time  and  place.  The  charge  must  set  out  that  portion  of  the 

evidence given by A which is alleged to be false. 

(d) A is accused of obstructing B, a public servant, in the discharge of his public functions at a given time and place. 

The charge must set out the manner in which A obstructed B in the discharge of his functions. 

(e)  A  is  accused  of  the  murder  of  B  at  a  given  time  and  place.  The  charge  need  not  state  the  manner  in  which  A 

murdered B. 

(f) A is accused of disobeying a direction of the law with intent to save B from punishment. The charge must set out the 

disobedience charged and the law infringed. 

214. Words in charge taken in sense of law under which offence is punishable.—In every charge 
words  used  in  describing  an  offence  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  used  in  the  sense  attached  to  them 
respectively by the law under which such offence is punishable. 

215. Effect of errors.— No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated 
in the charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particulars, shall be regarded at any  stage of 
the  case  as  material,  unless  the  accused  was  in  fact  misled  by  such  error  or  omission,  and  it  has 
occasioned a failure of justice. 

(a)  A  is  charged  under  section  242  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860),  with  “having  been  in  possession  of 
counterfeit  coin,  having  known  at  the  time  when  he  became  possessed  thereof  that  such  coin  was  counterfeit,”  the  word 
“fraudulently” being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not 
be regarded as material. 

(b)  A  is  charged  with  cheating  B,  and  the  manner  in  which  he  cheated  B  is  not  set  out  in  the  charge  or  is  set  out 
incorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this 
that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material. 

(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many 

Illustrations 

108 
 

transactions  between  A  and  B,  and  A  had  no  means  of  knowing  to  which  of  them  the  charge  referred,  and  offered  no 
defence.  The  Court  may  infer  from  such  facts  that  the  omission  to  set  out  the  manner  of  the  cheating  was,  in  the  case,  a 
material error. 

(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was 
Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and 
had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate,  which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer 
from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial. 

(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him 
for that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of 
Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from 
this that A was misled, and that the error was material. 

216.  Court  may  alter  charge.—(1)  Any  Court  may  alter  or  add  to  any  charge  at  any  time  before 

judgment is pronounced. 

(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused. 

(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not 
likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct 
of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with 
the trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge. 

(4)  If  the  alteration  or  addition  is  such  that  proceeding  immediately  with  the  trial  is  likely,  in  the 
opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a 
new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary. 

(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous 
sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction 
has  been  already  obtained  for  a  prosecution  on  the  same  facts  as  those  on  which  the  altered  or  added 
charge is founded. 

217.  Recall  of  witnesses  when  charge  altered.—Whenever  a  charge  is  altered  or  added  to  by  the 

Court after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed— 

(a) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness 
who may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that 
the prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re-examine such witness for the 
purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice; 

(b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material. 

B.—Joinder of charges 

218. Separate charges for distinct offences.—(1) For every distinct offence of which any person is 

accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately: 

Provided that where the accused person, by an application in writing, so desires and the Magistrate is 
of opinion that such person is not likely to be prejudiced thereby, the Magistrate may try together all or 
any number of the charges framed against such person. 

(2)  Nothing  in sub-section  (1) shall  affect the  operation  of  the  provisions  of sections  219,  220,  221 

and 223. 

109 
 

Illustration 

A is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on another occasion. A must be separately charged and 

separately tried for the theft and causing grievous hurt. 

219.  Three  offences  of same  kind within  year  may  be  charged together.—(1)  When  a  person  is 
accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from 
the first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with, 
and tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three. 

(2)  Offences  are  of  the  same  kind  when  they  are  punishable  with  the  same  amount  of  punishment 

under the same section of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or of any special or local law: 

Provided that, for the purposes of this section, an offence punishable under section 379 of the Indian 
Penal  Code  (45  of  1860)  shall  be  deemed  to  be  an  offence  of  the  same  kind  as  an  offence  punishable 
under section 380 of the said Code, and that an offence punishable under any section of the said Code, or 
of any special or local law, shall be deemed to be an offence of the same kind as an attempt to commit 
such offence, when such an attempt is an offence. 

220. Trial for more than one offence.—(1) If, in one series of acts so connected together as to form 
the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, 
and tried at one trial for, every such offence. 

(2)  When  a  person  charged  with  one  or  more  offences  of  criminal  breach  of  trust  or  dishonest 
misappropriation of property as provided in sub-section (2) of section 212 or in sub-section (1) of section 
219, is accused of committing, for the purpose of facilitating or concealing the commission of that offence 
or those offences, one or more offences of falsification of accounts, he may be charged with, and tried at 
one trial for, every such offence. 

(3) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law 
in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, the person accused of them may be 
charged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences. 

(4) If several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, 
constitute when combined a different offence, the person accused of them may be charged with, and tried 
at one trial for the offence constituted by such acts when combined, and for any offence constituted by 
any one, or more, of such acts. 

(5) Nothing contained in this section shall affect section 71 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). 

Illustrations to sub-section (1)

110 
 

charged with, and convicted of, the possession of each seal under section 473 of the Indian Penal Code. 

(e)  With  intent  to  cause  injury  to  B,  A  institutes  a  criminal  proceeding  against  him,  knowing  that  there  is  no  just  or 
lawful ground for such proceeding, and also falsely accuses B of having committed an offence, knowing that there is no just 
or lawful ground for such charge. A may be separately charged with, and convicted of, two offences under section 211 of the 
Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). 

(f) A, with intent to cause injury to B, falsely accuses him of having committed an offence, knowing that there is no just

concealing them. A and B thereupon voluntarily assist each other to conceal the sacks at the bottom of a grain-pit. A and B 
may  be  separately  charged  with,  and  convicted  of,  offences  under  sections  411  and  414  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code                    
(45 of 1860).

Code (45 of 1860). 

(l)  A  dishonestly  uses  a  forged  document  as  genuine  evidence,  in  order  to  convict  B,  a  public  servant,  of  an  offence 
under  section  167  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860).  A  may  be  separately  charged  with,  and  convicted  of,  offences 
under sections 471 (read with section 466) and 196 of that Code.

(m) A commits robbery on B, and in doing so voluntarily causes hurt to him. A may be separately charged with, and 

convicted of, offences under sections 323, 392 and 394 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). 

221. Where it is doubtful what offence has been committed.—(1) If a single act or series of acts is 
of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, 
the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such 
charges may be tried at once; or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of 
the said offences. 

(2)  If  in  such  a  case  the  accused  is  charged  with  one  offence,  and  it  appears  in  evidence  that  he 
committed a different offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of sub-section 
(1),  he  may  be  convicted  of  the  offence  which  he  is  shown  to  have  committed,  although  he  was  not 
charged with it. 

(a) A is accused of an act which may amount to theft, or receiving stolen property, or criminal breach of trust or cheating. He 
may  be  charged  with  theft,  receiving  stolen  property,  criminal  breach  of  trust  and  cheating,  or  he  may  be  charged  with  having 
committed theft, or receiving stolen property, or criminal breach of trust or cheating. 

(b) In the case mentioned, A is only charged with theft. It appears that he committed the offence of criminal breach of trust, or

111 
 

that of receiving stolen goods. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust or of receiving stolen goods (as the case may be), 
though he was not charged with such offence. 

(c) A states on oath before the Magistrate that he saw B hit C with a club. Before the Sessions Court A states on oath that B 
never hit C. A may be charged in the alternative and convicted of  intentionally giving false evidence, although it cannot be proved 
which of these contradictory statements was false. 

222.  When  offence  proved  included  in  offence  charged.—(1)  When  a  person  is  charged  with  an 
offence  consisting  of  several  particulars,  a  combination  of  some  only  of  which  constitutes  a  complete 
minor offence, and such combination is proved, but the remaining particulars are not proved, he may be 
convicted of the minor offence, though he was not charged with it. 

(2) When a person is charged with an offence and facts are proved which reduce it to a minor offence, 

he may be convicted of the minor offence, although he is not charged with it. 

(3)  When  a  person  is  charged  with  an  offence,  he  may  be  convicted  of  an  attempt  to  commit  such 

offence although the attempt is not separately charged. 

(4) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise a conviction of any minor offence where the 
conditions  requisite  for  the  initiation  of  proceedings  in  respect  of  that  minor  offence  have  not  been 
satisfied.  

Illustrations 

(a) A is charged, under section 407 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with criminal breach of trust in respect of 
property entrusted to him as a carrier. It appears, that he did commit criminal breach of trust under section 406 of that Code 
in respect of the property, but that it was not entrusted to him as a carrier. He may be convicted of criminal breach of trust 
under the said section 406. 

(b) A is charged, under section 325 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with causing grievous hurt. He proves that 

he acted on grave and sudden provocation. He may be convicted under section 335 of that Code. 

223.  What  persons  may  be  charged  jointly.—The  following  persons  may  be  charged  and  tried 

together, namely:— 

offence; 

(a) persons accused of the same offence committed in the course of the same transaction; 

(b) persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment of, or attempt to commit, such 

(c) persons accused of more than one offence of the same kind, within the meaning of section 219 

committed by them jointly within the period of twelve months; 

(d) persons accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction; 

(e)  persons  accused  of  an  offence  which  includes  theft,  extortion,  cheating,  or  criminal 
misappropriation,  and  persons  accused  of  receiving  or  retaining,  or  assisting  in  the  disposal  or 
concealment of, property possession of which is alleged to have been transferred by any such offence 
committed  by  the  first-named  persons,  or  of  abetment  of  or  attempting  to  commit  any  such  last-
named offence; 

112 
 

(f) persons accused of offences under sections 411 and 414 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) 
or either of those sections in respect of stolen property the possession of which has been transferred 
by one offence; 

(g)  persons  accused  of  any  offence  under  Chapter  XII  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860) 
relating to counterfeit coin and persons accused of any other offence under the said Chapter relating 
to  the  same  coin,  or  of  abetment  of  or  attempting  to  commit  any  such  offence;  and  the  provisions 
contained in the former part of this Chapter shall, so far as may be, apply to all such charges: 

Provided that where a number of persons are charged with separate offences and such persons do not 
fall  within  any  of  the  categories  specified  in  this  section,  the  1[Magistrate  or  Court  of  Session]  may,  if 
such persons by an application in writing, so desire, and  2[if he or it is satisfied] that such persons would 
not be prejudicially affected thereby, and it is expedient so to do, try all such persons together. 

224. Withdrawal of remaining charges on conviction on one of several charges.—When a charge 
containing more heads than one is framed against the same person, and when a conviction has been had 
on one or more of them, the complainant, or the officer conducting the prosecution, may, with the consent 
of  the  Court,  withdraw  the  remaining  charge  or  charges,  or  the  Court  of  its  own  accord  may  stay  the 
inquiry into, or trial of, such charge or charges and such withdrawal shall have the effect of an acquittal 
on such charge or charges, unless the conviction be set aside, in which case the said Court (subject to the 
order of the Court setting aside the conviction) may proceed with the inquiry into, or trial of, the charge or 
charges so withdrawn.

1872 (1 of 1872), may also be received in evidence at any subsequent stage of the case before another Court.

Act, 1897 (10 of 1897) or of section 188 of this Code. 

Explanation.—The dismissal of a complaint, or the discharge of the accused, is not an acquittal for the purposes 

of this section. 

Illustrations  

(a)  A  is  tried  upon  a  charge  of  theft  as  a  servant  and  aquitted.   He  cannot  afterwards,  while  the  acquittal  remains  in 

force, be charged with theft as a servant, or, upon the same facts, with theft simply, or with criminal breach of trust. 

(b) A is tried for causing grievous hurt and convicted.  The person injured afterwards dies.  A may be tried again for

not  afterwards  be  tried  for  voluntarily  causing  grievous  hurt  to  B  on  the  same  facts,  unless  the  case  comes  within                       
sub-section (3) of this section. 

(e) A is charged by a Magistrate of the second class with, and convicted by him of, theft of property from the person of 

B. A  may subsequently be charged with, and tried for, robbery on the same facts.   

(f) A, B and C are charged by a Magistrate of the first class with, and convicted by him of, robbing D.  A, B and C may 

afterwards be charged with, and tried for, dacoity on the same facts. 

301. Appearance by Public Prosecutors.—(1) The Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge 
of a case may appear and plead without any written authority before any Court in which that case is under inquiry, 
trial or appeal. 

(2) If in any such case any private person instructs a pleader to prosecute any person in any Court, the Public 
Prosecutor  or  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor  in  charge  of  the  case  shall  conduct  the  prosecution,  and  the  pleader  so 
instructed  shall  act  therein  under  the  directions  of  the  Public  Prosecutor  or  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor,  and  may, 
with the permission of the Court, submit written arguments after the evidence is closed in the case.

any Court in which that case is under inquiry, trial or appeal. 

(b)  The  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor  in  charge  of  a  case  may  appear  and  plead  without  any  written  authority

302. Permission to conduct prosecution.—(1) Any Magistrate inquiring into or trying a case may permit the 
prosecution to be conducted  by any person other than a police officer below the rank of inspector; but no  person, 
other  than  the  Advocate-General  or  Government  Advocate  or  a  Public  Prosecutor  or  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor, 

133 
 

shall be entitled to do so without such permission: 

Provided  that  no  police  officer  shall  be  permitted  to  conduct  the  prosecution  if  he  has  taken  part  in  the 

investigation into the offence with respect to which the accused is being prosecuted. 

(2) Any person conducting the prosecution may do so personally or by a pleader. 

303. Right of person against whom proceedings are instituted to be defended.—Any  person accused of an 
offence  before  a  Criminal  Court,  or  against  whom  proceedings  are  instituted  under  this  Code,  may  of  right  be 
defended by a pleader of his choice. 

304. Legal aid to accused at State expense in certain cases.—(1) Where, in a trial before the Court of Session, 
the  accused  is  not  represented  by  a  pleader,  and  where  it  appears  to  the  Court  that  the  accused  has  not  sufficient 
means to engage a pleader, the Court shall assign a pleader for his defence at the expense of the State. 

(2) The High Court may, with the previous approval of the State Government, make rules providing for— 

(a) the mode of selecting pleaders for defence under sub-section (1); 

(b) the facilities to be allowed to such pleaders by the Courts; 

(c)  the  fees  payable  to  such  pleaders  by  the  Government,  and  generally,  for  carrying  out  the  purposes  of 

sub-section (1). 

(3)  The  State  Government  may,  by  notification,  direct  that,  as  from  such  date  as  may  be  specified  in  the

305.  Procedure  when  corporation  or  registered  society  is  an  accused.—(1)  In  this  section,  “corporation” 
means  an  incorporated  company  or  other  body  corporate,  and  includes  a  society  registered  under  the  Societies 
Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860). 

(2) Where a corporation is the accused person or one of the accused persons in an inquiry or trial, it may appoint 
a  representative  for  the  purpose  of  the  inquiry  or  trial  and  such  appointment  need  not  be  under  the  seal  of  the 
corporation.  

(3) Where a representative of a corporation appears, any requirement of this Code that anything shall be done in 
the presence of the accused or shall be read or stated or explained to the accused, shall be construed as a requirement 
that thing shall be done in the presence of the representative or read or stated or explained to the representative, and 
any requirement that the accused shall be examined shall be construed as a requirement that the representative shall 
be examined. 

(4)  Where  a  representative  of  a  corporation  does  not  appear,  any  such  requirement  as  is  referred  to  in                     

sub-section (3) shall not apply. 

(5) Where a statement in writing purporting to be signed by the managing director of the corporation or by any 
person (by whatever name called) having, or being one of the persons having the management of the affairs of the 
corporation  to  the  effect  that  the  person  named  in  the  statement  has  been  appointed  as  the  representative  of  the 
corporation for the purposes of this section, is filed, the Court shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume that such 
person has been so appointed. 

(6) If a question arises as to whether any person, appearing as the representative of a corporation in an inquiry 

or trial before a Court is or is not such representative, the question shall be determined by the Court. 

306. Tender of pardon to accomplice.—(1) With a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to 
have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence to which this section applies, the Chief Judicial 

134 
 

Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate at any stage of the investigation or inquiry into, or the trial of, the offence, 
and  the  Magistrate  of  the  first  class  inquiring  into  or  trying  the  offence,  at  any  stage  of  the  inquiry  or  trial,  may 
tender  a  pardon  to  such  person  on  condition  of  his  making  a  full  and  true  disclosure  of  the  whole  of  the 
circumstances  within  his  knowledge  relative  to  the  offence  and  to  every  other  person  concerned,  whether  as 
principal or abettor, in the commission thereof. 

(2) This section applies to— 

(a)  any  offence  triable  exclusively  by  the  Court  of  Session  or  by  the  Court  of  a  Special  Judge  appointed 

under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 (46 of 1952); 

(b)  any  offence  punishable  with  imprisonment  which  may  extend  to  seven  years  or  with  a  more  severe 

sentence.  

(3) Every Magistrate who tenders a pardon under sub-section (1) shall record— 

(a) his reasons for so doing; 

(b) whether the tender was or was not accepted by the person to whom it was made, 

and shall, on application made by the accused, furnish him with a copy of such record free of cost. 

(4) Every person accepting a tender of pardon made under sub-section (1)— 

(a) shall be examined as a witness in the Court of the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence and in 

the subsequent trial, if any; 

(b) shall, unless he is already on bail, be detained in custody until the termination of the trial. 

(5) Where a person has accepted a tender of pardon made under sub-section (1) and has been examined under 
sub-section  (4),  the  Magistrate  taking  cognizance  of  the  offence  shall,  without  making  any  further  inquiry  in  the 
case— 

(a) commit it for trial— 

(i) to the Court of Session if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court or if the Magistrate taking 

cognizance is the Chief Judicial Magistrate; 

(ii) to a Court of Special Judge appointed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952 (46 of 1952), 

if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court; 

(b) in any other case, make over the case to the Chief Judicial Magistrate who shall try the case himself. 

307.  Power  to  direct  tender  of  pardon.—At  any  time  after  commitment  of  a  case  but  before  judgment  is 
passed, the Court to which the commitment is made may, with a view to obtaining at the trial the evidence of any 
person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in, or privy to, any such offence, tender a pardon on 
the same condition to such person. 

308. Trial of person not complying with conditions of pardon.—(1) Where, in regard to a person  who  has 
accepted a tender of pardon made under section 306 or section 307, the Public Prosecutor certifies that in his opinion 
such person has, either by wilfully concealing anything essential or by giving false evidence, not complied with the 
condition on  which the tender  was  made, such person  may  be tried for the offence in respect of  which the pardon 
was  so  tendered  or  for  any  other  offence  of  which  he  appears  to  have  been  guilty  in  connection  with  the  same 
matter, and also for the offence of giving false evidence: 

135 
 

Provided that such person shall not be tried jointly with any of the other accused: 

Provided  further  that  such  person  shall  not  be  tried  for  the  offence  of  giving  false  evidence  except  with  the 

sanction of the High Court, and nothing contained in section 195 or section 340 shall apply to that offence. 

(2)  Any  statement  made  by  such  person  accepting  the  tender  of  pardon  and  recorded  by  a  Magistrate  under 

section 164 or by a Court under sub-section (4) of section 306 may be given in evidence against him at such trial. 

(3) At such trial, the accused shall be entitled to plead that he has complied with the condition upon which such 
tender  was  made;  in  which  case  it  shall  be  for  the  prosecution  to  prove  that  the  condition  has  not  been  complied 
with. 

(4) At such trial, the Court shall— 

(a) if it is a Court of Session, before the charge is read out and explained to the accused; 

(b) if it is the Court of a Magistrate, before the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution is taken, 

ask  the  accused  whether  he  pleads  that  he  has  complied  with  the  conditions  on  which  the  tender  of  pardon  was 
made.                    

(5) If the accused does so plead, the Court shall record the plea and proceed with the trial and it shall, before 

passing  judgment  in  the  case,  find  whether  or  not    the    accused    has    complied    with    the  conditions  of  the           
pardon,  and,    if  it  finds  that  he  has  so  complied,  it  shall,  notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this  Code,  pass 
judgment of acquittal. 

309.  Power  to  postpone  or  adjourn  proceedings.—1[(1)  In  every  inquiry  or  trial  the  proceedings  shall  be 
continued  from  day-to-day  until  all  the  witnesses  in  attendance  have  been  examined,  unless  the  Court  finds  the 
adjournment of the same beyond the following day to be necessary for reasons to be recorded: 

Provided that  when  the inquiry or trial relates to an offence under section 376,  2[section 376A,  section 376AB,  , 
section 376B, section 376C, section 376D, section 376DA or section DB  of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the inquiry or 
trial shall] be completed within a period of two months from the date of filing of the charge sheet.] 

 (2)  If  the  Court,  after  taking  cognizance  of  an  offence,  or  commencement  of  trial,  finds  it  necessary  or 
advisable to postpone the commencement of, or adjourn, any inquiry or trial, it may, from time to time, for reasons 
to be recorded, postpone or adjourn the same on such terms as it thinks fit, for such time as it considers reasonable,  
and may by a warrant remand the accused if in custody: 

Provided that no Magistrate shall remand an accused person to custody under this section for a term exceeding 

fifteen days at a time: 

Provided  further  that  when  witnesses  are  in  attendance,  no  adjournment  or  postponement  shall  be  granted, 

without examining them, except for special reasons to be recorded in writing: 

3[Provided  also  that  no  adjournment  shall  be  granted  for  the  purpose  only  of  enabling  the  accused  person  to 

show cause against the sentence proposed to be imposed on him.] 

4[Provided also that— 

(a) no adjournment shall be granted at the request of a party, except  where the circumstances are beyond 

                                                 
1. Subs. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 21, for sub-section (1) (w.e.f. 3-2-2013).  
2. Subs. by Act 22 of 2018, s. 16, for “section 376A, section 376B, section 376C, section 376D” (w.e.f. 21-4-2018).  
3. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 24 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).

136 
 

the control of that party; 

(b) the fact that the pleader of a party is engaged in another Court, shall not be a ground for adjournment; 

(c) where a witness is present in Court but a party or his pleader is not present or the party or his pleader 
though  present  in  Court,  is  not  ready  to  examine  or  cross-examine  the  witness,  the  Court  may,  if  thinks  fit, 
record the statement of the witness and pass such orders as it thinks fit dispensing with the examination-in-chief 
or cross-examination of the witness, as the case may be.] 

Explanation  1.—If  sufficient  evidence  has  been  obtained  to  raise  a  suspicion  that  the  accused  may  have 
committed an offence, and it appears likely that further evidence may be obtained by a remand, this is a reasonable 
cause for a remand. 

Explanation 2.—The terms on which an adjournment or postponement may be granted include, in appropriate 

cases, the payment of costs by the prosecution or the accused.

order to that effect and in that case the person to whom the order relates shall be produced or shall attend at the time

show he has committed. 

2[(5) The Court may take help of Prosecutor and Defence Counsel in preparing relevant questions which are to

trial. 

(2) Any person against whom proceedings are instituted in any Criminal Court under section 98, or section 107

stage of an inquiry or trial under this Code, if the Judge or Magistrate is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded, that the 
personal attendance of the accused before the Court is not  necessary in the interests of justice, or that the accused 
persistently  disturbs  the  proceedings  in  Court,  the  Judge  or  Magistrate  may,  if  the  accused  is  represented  by  a 
pleader,  dispense  with  his  attendance  and  proceed  with  such  inquiry  or  trial  in  his  absence,  and  may,  at  any 
subsequent stage of the proceedings, direct the personal attendance of such accused. 

(2) If the accused in any such case is not represented by a pleader, or if the Judge or Magistrate considers his 
personal attendance necessary, he  may, if  he thinks fit and  for reasons to be recorded by him, either adjourn such

318.  Procedure  where  accused  does  not  understand  proceedings.—If  the  accused,  though  not  of  unsound 
mind,  cannot  be  made  to  understand  the  proceedings,  the  Court  may  proceed  with  the  inquiry  or  trial;  and,  in  the

prosecution of any person either generally or in respect of any one or more of the offences for which he is tried; and, 
upon such withdrawal,— 

(a) if it is made before a charge has been framed, the accused shall be discharged in respect of such offence 

or offences; 

(b) if it is made after a charge has been framed, or when under this Code no charge is required, he shall be

prosecution and the Court shall, before according consent, direct the Prosecutor to produce before it the permission 
granted by the Central Government to withdraw from the prosecution. 

322.  Procedure  in  cases  which  Magistrate  cannot  dispose  of.—(1)  If,  in  the  course  of  any  inquiry  into  an 

offence or a trial before a Magistrate in any district, the evidence appears to him to warrant a presumption— 

(a) that he has no jurisdiction to try the case or commit it for trial, or 

(b) that the case is one which should be tried or committed for trial by some other Magistrate in the district, 

or 

(c) that the case should be tried by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, he shall stay the proceedings and submit 
the case, with a brief report explaining its nature, to the Chief Judicial Magistrate or to such other Magistrate, 
having jurisdiction, as the Chief Judicial Magistrate directs. 

(2) The Magistrate to whom the case is submitted may, if so empowered, either try the case himself, or refer it 

to any Magistrate subordinate to him having jurisdiction, or commit the accused for trial. 

323.  Procedure  when,  after  commencement  of  inquiry  or  trial,  Magistrate  finds  case  should  be 
committed.—If, in any inquiry into an offence or a trial before a Magistrate, it appears to him at any stage of the 
proceedings  before  signing  the  judgment  that  the  case  is  one  which  ought  to  be  tried  by  the  Court  of  Session,  he 
shall commit it to that Court under the provisions hereinbefore contained 1[and thereupon the provisions of Chapter 
XVIII shall apply to the commitment so made]. 

324.  Trial  of  persons  previously  convicted  of  offences  against  coinage,  stamp-law  or  property.—  (1) 

Where a person, having been convicted of an offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII of the Indian 

Penal Code (45 of 1860), with imprisonment for a term of three years or upwards, is again accused of any offence 

punishable  under  either  of  those  Chapters  with  imprisonment  for  a  term  of  three  years  or  upwards,  and  the 

Magistrate  before  whom  the  case  is  pending  is  satisfied  that  there  is  ground  for  presuming  that  such  person  has 

committed  the  offence,  he  shall  be  sent  for  trial  to  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  or  committed  to  the  Court  of 

Session, unless  the Magistrate is competent  to try  the case and is of opinion that he can himself pass an adequate 

sentence if the accused is convicted. 

 (2)  When  any  person  is  sent  for  trial  to  the  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  or  committed  to  the  Court  of  Session 

under sub-section (1), any other person accused jointly with him in the same inquiry or trial shall be similarly sent or 

committed, unless the Magistrate discharges such other person under section 239 or section 245, as the case may be. 

325. Procedure when Magistrate cannot pass sentence sufficiently severe.—(1) Whenever a Magistrate is of 

opinion, after hearing the evidence for the prosecution and the accused, that the accused is guilty, and that he ought 

to  receive  a  punishment  different  in  kind  from,  or  more  severe  than,  that  which  such  Magistrate  is  empowered  to 

inflict, or, being a  Magistrate of the  second class, is of opinion that the accused ought to be required to execute a 

bond  under  section  106,  he  may  record  the  opinion  and  submit  his  proceedings,  and  forward  the  accused,  to  the 

Chief Judicial Magistrate to whom he is subordinate. 

(2) When more accused than one are being tried together, and the Magistrate considers it necessary to proceed 

under  sub-section  (1),  in  regard  to  any  of  such  accused,  he  shall  forward  all  the  accused,  who  are  in  his  opinion 

guilty, to the Chief Judicial Magistrate. 

                                                 
1. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 26 (w.e.f. 18-12-1978).  

146 
 

(3)  The  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  to  whom  the  proceedings  are  submitted  may,  if  he  thinks  fit,  examine  the 

parties and recall and examine any witness who has already given evidence in the case and may call for and take any 

further evidence and shall pass such judgment, sentence or order in the case as he thinks fit, and is according to law. 

326.  Conviction  or  commitment  on  evidence  partly  recorded  by  one  Magistrate  and  partly  by                  

another.—(1) Whenever any  1[Judge or Magistrate], after having heard and recorded the whole or any part of the 
evidence  in  any  enquiry  or  a  trial,  ceases  to  exercise  jurisdiction  therein  and  is  succeeded  by  another  1[Judge  or 
Magistrate] who has and  who exercises such jurisdiction, the  1[Judge or Magistrate] so succeeding may act on the 
evidence so recorded by his predecessor, or partly recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by himself: 

Provided  that  if  the  succeeding  1[Judge  or  Magistrate]  is  of  opinion  that  further  examination  of  any  of  the 
witnesses whose evidence has already been recorded is necessary in the interests of Justice, he may re-summon any 
such  witness, and after such  further examination, cross-examination and re-examination, if any, as he  may permit, 
the witness shall be discharged. 

(2) When a case is transferred under the provisions of this Code  2[from one judge to another Judge or from one 
Magistrate  to  another  Magistrate],  the  former  shall  be  deemed  to  cease  to  exercise  jurisdiction  therein,  and  to  be 
succeeded by the latter, within the meaning of sub-section (1). 

(3) Nothing in this section applies to summary trials or to cases in which proceedings have been stayed under 

section 322 or in which proceedings have been submitted to a superior Magistrate under section 325. 

327. Court to be open.—3[(1)] The place in which any Criminal Court is held for the purpose of inquiring into 
or trying any offence shall be deemed to be an open Court, to which the public generally may have access, so far as 
the same can conveniently contain them: 

Provided that the presiding Judge or Magistrate may, if he thinks fit, order at any stage of any inquiry into, or 
trial  of,  any  particular  case,  that  the  public  generally,  or  any  particular  person,  shall  not  have  access  to,  or  be  or 
remain in, the room or building used by the Court. 

4[(2)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  sub-  section  (1),  the  inquiry  into  and  trial  of  rape  or  an  offence 
under  section  376,  5[section  376A,  section  376AB,  section  376B,  section  376C,  section  376D,  section  376DA, 
section 376DB] section 376E of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860)] shall be conducted in camera : 

Provided that the presiding Judge may, if he thinks fit, or on an application made by either of the parties, allow 

any particular person to have access to, or be or remain in,  the room or building used by the Court: 

6[Provided further that in camera trial shall be conducted as far as practicable by a woman Judge or Magistrate.]  

(3)  Where  any  proceedings  are  held  under  sub-section  (2),  it  shall  not  be  lawful  for  any  person  to  print  or 

publish any matter in relation to any such proceedings except with the previous permission of the Court:] 

 6[Provided that the ban on printing or publication of trial proceedings in relation to an offence of rape may be 

lifted, subject to maintaining confidentiality of name and address of the parties.]

CHAPTER XXV 

PROVISIONS AS TO ACCUSED PERSONS OF UNSOUND MIND 

328.  Procedure  in  case  of  accused  being  lunatic.—(1)  When  a  Magistrate  holding  an  inquiry  has  reason  to 
believe that  the person against  whom  the inquiry  is being  held is of unsound  mind and  consequently incapable of 
making  his  defence,  the  Magistrate  shall  inquire  into  the  fact  of  such  unsoundness  of  mind,  and  shall  cause  such 
person to be examined by the civil surgeon of the district or such other medical officer as the State Government may 
direct, and thereupon shall examine such surgeon or other officer as a witness, and shall reduce the examination to 
writing.  

1[(1A) If the civil surgeon finds the accused to be of unsound mind, he shall refer such person to a psychiatrist 
or  clinical  psychologist  for  care,  treatment  and  prognosis  of  the  condition  and  the  psychiatrist  or  clinical 
psychologist, as the case may be, shall inform the Magistrate whether the accused is suffering from unsoundness of 
mind or mental retardation: 

Provided that if the accused is aggrieved by the information given by the psychiatric or clinical psychologist, as 

the case may be, to the Magistrate, he may prefer an appeal before the Medical Board which shall consist of— 

(a) head of psychiatry unit in the nearest government hospital; and 

 (b) a faculty member in psychiatry in the nearest medical college.]  

(2)  Pending  such  examination  and  inquiry,  the  Magistrate  may  deal  with  such  person  in  accordance  with  the 

provisions of section 330. 

2[(3) If such Magistrate is informed that the person referred to in sub-section (1A) is a person of unsound mind, 
the Magistrate shall further determine  whether the unsoundness of  mind renders the accused incapable of entering 
defence  and  if  the  accused  is  found  so  incapable,  the  Magistrate  shall  record  a  finding  to  that  effect,  and  shall 
examine  the  record  of  evidence  produced  by  the  prosecution  and  after  hearing  the  advocate  of  the  accused  but 
without  questioning  the  accused,  if  he  finds  that  no  prima  facie  case  is  made  out  against  the  accused,  he  shall, 
instead  of  postponing  the  enquiry,  discharge  the  accused  and  deal  with  him  in  the  manner  provided  under        
section 330: 

Provided that if the Magistrate finds that a prima facie case is made out against the accused in respect of whom 
a finding of unsoundness of mind is arrived at, he shall postpone the proceeding for such period, as in the opinion of 
the  psychiatrist  or  clinical  psychologist,  is  required  for  the  treatment  of  the  accused,  and  order  the  accused  to  be 
dealt with as provided under section 330. 

(4)  If  such  Magistrate  is  informed  that  the  person  referred  to  in  sub-section  (1A)  is  a  person  with  mental

retardation, the Magistrate shall further determine  whether the  mental retardation renders the  accused incapable of 
entering defence, and if the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate shall order closure of the inquiry and deal 
with the accused in the manner provided under section 330.]  

329.  Procedure  in  case  of  person  of  unsound  mind  tried  before  Court.—(1)  If  at  the  trial  of  any  person 
before a Magistrate or Court of Session, it appears to the Magistrate or Court that such person is of unsound mind 
and consequently incapable of making his defence, the Magistrate or Court shall, in the first instance, try the fact of 
such unsoundness and incapacity, and if the Magistrate or Court, after considering such medical and other evidence 
as  may be produced before him or it, is satisfied of the  fact, he or it shall record a finding to that effect and  shall 
postpone further proceedings in the case. 

1[(1A) If during trial, the Magistrate or Court of Sessions finds the accused to be of unsound mind, he or it shall 
refer  such  person  to  a  psychiatrist  or  clinical  psychologist  for  care  and  treatment,  and  the  psychiatrist  or  clinical 
psychologist,  as  the  case  may  be    shall  report  to  the  Magistrate  or  Court  whether  the  accused  is  suffering  from 
unsoundness of mind: 

Provided that if the accused is aggrieved by the information given by the psychiatric or clinical psychologist, as 

the case may be, to the Magistrate, he may prefer an appeal before the Medical Board which shall consist of— 

(a) head of psychiatry unit in the nearest government hospital; and 

(b) a faculty member in psychiatry in the nearest medical college.]  

2[(2)  If  such  Magistrate  or  Court  is  informed  that  the  person  referred  to  in  sub-section  (1A)  is  a  person  of 
unsound  mind,  the  Magistrate  or  Court  shall  further  determine  whether  unsoundness  of  mind  renders  the  accused 
incapable of entering defence and if the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate or Court shall record a finding 
to that effect and shall examine the record of evidence produced by the prosecution and after hearing the advocate of 
the accused but without questioning the accused, if the Magistrate or Court finds that no  prima facie case is made 
out against the accused, he or it shall, instead of postponing the trial, discharge the accused and deal with him in the 
manner provided under section 330: 

Provided that if the Magistrate or Court finds that a prima facie case is made out against the accused in respect 
of whom a finding of unsoundness of mind is arrived at, he shall postpone the trial for such period, as in the opinion 
of the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, is required for the treatment of the accused. 

(3) If the Magistrate or Court finds that a prima facie case is made out against the accused and he is incapable of 
entering defence by reason of mental retardation, he or it shall not hold the trial and order the accused to be dealt 
with in accordance with section 330.]  

3[330. Release of person of unsound mind pending investigation or trial.—(1) Whenever a person if found 
under section 328 or section 329 to be incapable of entering defence by reason of unsoundness of mind or mental 
retardation, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be shall, whether the case is one in which bail may be taken or 
not, order release of such person on bail: 

Provided that the accused is suffering from unsoundness of mind or mental retardation which does not mandate 
in-patient treatment and a friend or relative undertakes to obtain regular out-patient psychiatric treatment  from the 
nearest medical facility and to prevent from doing injury to himself or to any other person. 

(2)  If  the  case  is  one  in  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Magistrate  or  Court,  as  the  case  may  be,  bail  cannot  be 
granted or if an appropriate undertaking is not given, he or it shall order the accused to be kept in such a place where 
regular psychiatric treatment can be provided, and shall report the action taken to the State Government: 

Provided  that  no  order  for  the  detention  of  the  accused  in  a  lunatic  asylum  shall  be  made  otherwise  than  in 
accordance  with  such  rules  as  the  State  Government  may  have  made  under  the  Mental  Health  Act,  1987  (14  of 
1987). 

(3) Whenever a person is found under section 328 or section 329 to be incapable of entering defence by reason 
of unsoundness of mind or mental retardation, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, shall keeping in view the 
nature  of  the  act  committed  and  the  extent  of  unsoundness  of  mind  or  mental  retardation,  further  determine  if  the 
release of the accused can be ordered: 

                                                 
1. Ins. by Act 5 of 2009, s. 26 (w.e.f. 31-12-2009) 
2. Subs. by s. 26, ibid., for sub-section (2), (w.e.f. 31-12-2009).  
3. Subs. by s. 27, ibid., for section 330 (w.e.f. 31-12-2009). 

149 
 

Provided that— 

(a) if on the basis of medical opinion or opinion of a specialist, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, 
decide  to  order  discharge  of  the  accused,  as  provided  under  section  328  or  section  329,  such  release  may  be 
ordered, if sufficient security is given that the accused shall be prevented from doing injury to himself or to any 
other person; 

(b)  if  the  Magistrate  or  Court,  as  the  case  may  be,  is  of  opinion  that  discharge  of  the  accused  cannot  be 
ordered, the transfer of the accused to a residential facility for persons of unsound mind or mental retardation 
may be ordered wherein the accused may be provided care and appropriate education and training.]  

331.  Resumption  of  inquiry  or  trial.—(1) Whenever  an  inquiry  or  a  trial  is  postponed  under  section  328  or 
section 329, the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, may at any time after the person concerned has ceased to 
be  of  unsound  mind,  resume  the  inquiry  or  trial  and  require  the  accused  to  appear  or  be  brought  before  such 
Magistrate or Court. 

(2) When the accused has been released under section 330, and the sureties for his appearance produce him to 
the officer  whom the Magistrate or Court appoints in this  behalf, the certificate of such officer that the accused is 
capable of making his defence shall be receivable in evidence. 

332. Procedure on accused appearing before Magistrate or Court.—(1) If, when the accused appears or is 
again brought before the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, the Magistrate or Court considers him capable of 
making his defence, the inquiry or trial shall proceed. 

(2) If the Magistrate or Court considers the accused to be still incapable of making his defence, the Magistrate 
or Court shall act according to the provisions of section 328 or section 329, as the case may be, and if the accused is 
found  to  be  of  unsound  mind  and  consequently  incapable  making  his  defence,  shall  deal  with  such  accused  in 
accordance with the provisions of section 330. 

333. When accused appears to have been of sound mind.—When the accused appears to be of sound mind at 
the time of inquiry or trial, and the Magistrate is satisfied from the evidence given before him that there is reason to 
believe that the accused committed an act, which, if he had been of sound mind, would have been an offence, and 
that he was, at the time when the act was committed, by reason of unsoundness of mind, incapable of knowing the 
nature  of  the  act  or  that  it  was  wrong  or  contrary  to  law,  the  Magistrate  shall  proceed  with  the  case,  and,  if  the 
accused ought to be tried by the Court of Session, commit him for trial before the Court of Session. 

334. Judgment of acquittal on ground of unsoundness of mind.—Whenever any person is acquitted upon the 
ground that, at the time at which he is alleged to have committed an offence, he was, by reason of unsoundness of 
mind, incapable of knowing the nature of the act alleged as constituting the offence, or that it was wrong or contrary 
to law, the finding shall state specifically whether he committed the act or not. 

335. Person acquitted on such ground to be detained in safe custody.—(1) Whenever the finding states that 

the accused person committed the act alleged, the Magistrate or Court before whom or which the trial has been held, 

shall, if such act would, but for the incapacity found, have constituted an offence,— 

 (a) order such person to be detained in safe custody in such place and manner as the Magistrate or Court 

thinks fit; or 

Act, 1912 (4 of 1912). 

(b) order such person to be delivered to any relative or friend of such person. 

(2) No order for the detention of the accused in a lunatic asylum shall be made under clause  (a) of sub-section 

(1) otherwise than in accordance with such rules as the State Government may have made under the Indian Lunacy 

(3) No order for the delivery of the accused to a relative or friend shall be made under clause (b) of sub-section 

(1)  except  upon  the  application  of  such  relative  or  friend  and  on  his  giving  security  to  the  satisfaction  of  the 

Magistrate or Court that the person delivered shall— 

(a) be properly taken care of and prevented from doing injury to himself or to any other person; 

(b) be produced for the inspection of such officer, and at such times and places, as the State Government 

may direct. 

150 
 

(4) The Magistrate or Court shall report to the State Government the action taken under sub-section (1). 

336. Power of State Government to empower officer-in-charge to discharge.—The State Government may 

empower the officer in charge of the jail in which a person is confined under the provisions of section 330 or section 

335 to discharge all or any of the functions of the Inspector-General of Prisons under section 337 or section 338. 

337.  Procedure  where  lunatic  prisoner  is  reported  capable  of  making  his  defence.—If  such  person  is 

detained  under  the  provisions  of  sub-section  (2)  of  section  330,  and  in  the  case  of  a  person  detained  in  a  jail,  the 

Inspector-General of Prisons, or, in the case of a person detained a lunatic asylum, the visitors of such asylum, or 

any two of them shall certify that, in his or their opinion, such person is capable of making his defence, he shall be 

taken before the Magistrate or Court, as the case may be, at such time as the Magistrate or Court appoints, and the 

Magistrate  or  Court  shall  deal  with  such  person  under  the  provisions  of  section  332;  and  the  certificate  of  such 

Inspector-General or visitors as aforesaid shall be receivable as evidence. 

338. Procedure where lunatic detained is declared fit to be released.—(1) If such person is detained under 
the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 330, or section 335, and such Inspector-General or visitors shall certify 
that,  in  his  or  their  judgment,  he  may  be  released  without  danger  of  his  doing  injury  to  himself  or  to  any  other 
person,  the  State  Government  may  thereupon  order  him  to  be  released,  or  to  be  detained  in  custody,  or  to  be 
transferred to a public lunatic asylum if he has not been already sent to such an asylum; and, in case it orders him to 
be transferred to an asylum, may appoint a Commission, consisting of a Judicial and two medical officers. 

(2) Such Commission shall make a formal inquiry into the state of mind of such person, take such evidence as is 

necessary, and shall report to the State Government, which may order his release or detention as it thinks fit. 

339.  Delivery  of  lunatic  to  care  of  relative  or  friend.—(1)  Whenever  any  relative  or  friend  of  any  person 
detained under the provisions of section 330 or section 335 desires that he shall be delivered to his care and custody, 
the  State  Government  may,  upon  the  application  of  such  relative  or  friend  and  on  his  giving  security  to  the 
satisfaction of such State Government, that the person delivered shall— 

(a) be properly taken care of and prevented from doing injury to himself or to any other person; 

(b) be produced for the inspection of such officer, and at such times and places, as the State Government 

may direct; 

such Magistrate or Court,  

(c) in the case of a person detained under sub-section (2) of section 330, be produced when required before 

order such person to be delivered to such relative or friend. 

 (2) If the person so delivered is accused of any offence, the trial of which has been postponed by reason of his 
being of unsound mind and incapable of making his defence, and the inspecting officer referred to in clause  (b) of 
sub-section (1), certifies at any time to the Magistrate or Court that such person is capable of making his defence, 
such Magistrate or Court shall call upon the relative or friend to whom such accused was delivered to produce him 
before the Magistrate or Court; and, upon such production the Magistrate or Court shall proceed in accordance with 
the provisions of section 332, and the certificate of the inspecting office shall be receivable as evidence. 

CHAPTER XXVI 

PROVISIONS AS TO OFFENCES AFFECTING THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE 

340. Procedure in cases mentioned in section 195.—(1) When, upon an application made to it in this behalf or 
otherwise, any Court is of opinion that it is expedient in the interests of Justice that an inquiry should be made into 
any offence referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 195, which appears to have been committed in or in 
relation to a proceeding in that Court or, as the case may be, in respect of a document produced or given in evidence  

 

151 
 

in a proceeding in that Court, such Court may, after such preliminary inquiry, if any, as it thinks necessary,— 

(a) record a finding to that effect; 

(b) make a complaint thereof in writing; 

(c) send it to a Magistrate of the first class having jurisdiction; 

(d) take sufficient security for the appearance of the accused before such Magistrate, or if the alleged 

offence is non-bailable and the Court thinks it necessary so to do, send the accused in custody to such 
Magistrate; and 

(e) bind over any person to appear and give evidence before such Magistrate. 

(2)  The  power  conferred  on  a  Court  by  sub-section  (1)  in  respect  of  an  offence  may,  in  any  case  where  that 
Court has neither made a complaint under sub-section (1) in respect of that offence nor rejected an application for 
the  making  of  such  complaint,  be  exercised  by  the  Court  to  which  such  former  Court  is  subordinate  within  the 
meaning of sub-section (4) of section 195. 

 (3) A complaint made under this section shall be signed,— 

(a) where the Court making the complaint is a High Court, by such officer of the Court as the Court may 

appoint; 

1[(b)  in  any  other  case,  by  the  presiding  officer  of  the  Court  or by  such  officer  of  the  Court  as  the  Court 

may authorise in writing in this behalf.] 

 (4) In this section, “Court” has the same meaning as in section 195. 

341. Appeal.—(1) Any person on whose application any Court other than a High Court has refused to make a 
complaint under sub-section (1)  or sub-section (2) of section 340, or against whom such a complaint has been made 
by such Court, may appeal to the Court to which such former Court is subordinate within the meaning of sub-section 
(4) of section 195, and the superior Court may thereupon, after notice to the parties concerned, direct the withdrawal 
of the complaint, or, as the case may be, making of the complaint which such former Court might have made  under 
section 340, and, if it makes such complaint, the provisions of that section shall apply accordingly. 

(2) An order under this  section, and subject to any  such order, an order under section 340, shall be final, and 

shall not be subject to revision. 

342.  Power  to  order  costs.—Any  Court  dealing  with  an  application  made  to  it  for  filing  a  complaint  under 

section 340 or an appeal under section 341, shall have power to make such order as to costs as may be just. 

343.  Procedure  of  Magistrate  taking  cognizance.—(1)  A  Magistrate  to  whom  a  complaint  is  made  under 

section 340 or section 341 shall, notwithstanding anything contained in Chapter XV, proceed, as far as may be, to 

deal with the case as if it were instituted on a police report. 

(2) Where it is brought to the notice of such Magistrate, or of any other Magistrate to whom the case may have 

been transferred, that an appeal is pending against the decision arrived at in the judicial proceeding out of which the 

matter has arisen, he may, if he thinks fit, at any stage, adjourn the hearing of the case until such appeal is decided. 

344. Summary procedure for trial for giving false evidence.—(1) If, at the time of delivery of any judgment 

or final order disposing of any judicial proceeding, a Court of Session or Magistrate of the first class expresses an 

opinion to the effect that any witness appearing in such proceeding had knowingly or wilfully given false evidence 

or  had  fabricated  false  evidence  with  the  intention  that  such  evidence  should  be  used  in  such  proceeding,  it  or  he 

may, if satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in the interest of justice that the witness should be tried summarily 

for giving or fabricating, as the case may be, false evidence, take cognizance of the offence and may, after giving the 

                                                 
1. Subs. by Act 2 of 2006, s. 6, for clause (b) (w.e.f. 16-4-2006).

offender  a  reasonable  opportunity  of  showing  cause  why  he  should  not  be  punished  for  such  offence,  try  such 

offender  summarily  and  sentence  him  to  imprisonment  for  a  term  which  may  extend  to  three  months,  or  to  fine 

which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. 

(2)  In  every  such  case  the  Court  shall  follow,  as  nearly  as  may  be  practicable,  the  procedure  prescribed  for 

summary trials. 

(3)  Nothing  in  this  section  shall  affect  the  power  of  the  Court  to  make  a  complaint  under  section  340  for  the 

offence, where it does not choose to proceed under this section. 

(4)  Where,  after  any  action  is  initiated  under  sub-section  (1),  it  is  made  to  appear  to  the  Court  of  Session  or 

Magistrate  of  the  first  class  that  an  appeal  or  an  application  for  revision  has  been  preferred  or  filed  against  the 

judgment or order in which the opinion referred to in that sub-section has been expressed, it or he shall stay further 

proceedings  of  the  trial  until  the  disposal  of  the  appeal  or  the  application  for  revision,  as  the  case  may  be,  and 

thereupon the further proceedings of the trial shall abide by the results of the appeal or application for revision. 

345.  Procedure  in  certain  cases  of  contempt.—(1)  When  any  such  offence  as  is  described  in  section  175, 
section 178, section 179, section 180 or section 228 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) is committed in the view 
or presence of any Civil, Criminal, or Revenue Court, the Court may cause the offender to be detained in custody, 
and may, at any time before the rising of the Court or the same day, take cognizance of the offence and, after giving 
the offender a reasonable opportunity of showing cause why he should not be punished under this section, sentence 
the offender to fine not exceeding two hundred rupees, and, in default of  payment of fine, to simple imprisonment 
for a term which may extend to one month, unless such fine be sooner paid. 

(2) In every such case the Court shall record the fact constituting the offence, with the statement (if any) made 

by the offender, as well as the finding and sentence. 

 (3) If the offence is under section 228 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the record shall show the nature 
and  stage  of  the  judicial  proceeding  in  which  the  Court  interrupted  or  insulted  was  sitting,  and  the  nature  of  the 
interruption or insult. 

346.    Procedure  where  Court    considers  that  case  should  not  be  dealt  with  under  section  345.—(1)  If  the 
Court in any case considers that a person accused of any of the offences  referred to in section 345 and committed in its 
view  or  presence  should  be  imprisoned  otherwise  than  in  default  of  payment  of  fine,  or  that  a  fine  exceeding  two 
hundred rupees should be imposed upon him, or such Court is for any other reason of opinion that the case should not 
be disposed of under section 345, such Court, after recording  the facts constituting the offence and the statement of the 
accused as hereinbefore provided, may forward  the case to a  Magistrate  having  jurisdiction  to try  the same, and 
may require security to be given for the appearance of such person before such Magistrate, or if sufficient security is 
not given, shall forward such person in custody to such Magistrate. 

(2) The Magistrate to whom any case is forwarded under this section shall proceed to deal with, as far as may 

be, as if it were instituted on a police report. 

347. When Registrar or Sub-Registrar to be deemed a Civil Court.—When the State Government so directs,

be a Civil Court within the meaning of sections 345 and 346. 

348. Discharge of offender on submission of apology.—When any Court has under section 345 adjudged an 
offender to punishment, or has under section 346 forwarded him to a Magistrate for trial, for refusing or omitting to 
do anything which he was lawfully required to do or for any intentional insult or interruption, the Court may, in its 
discretion,  discharge  the  offender  or  remit  the  punishment  on  his  submission  to  the  order  or  requisition  of  such 
Court, or on apology being made to its satisfaction. 

349.  Imprisonment  or  committal  of  person  refusing  to  answer  or  produce  document.—If  any  witness  or 
person called to produce a document or thing before a Criminal Court refuses to answer such questions as are put to

such Court may, for reasons to be recorded in writing, sentence him to simple imprisonment, or by warrant under the 
hand  of  the  Presiding  Magistrate  or  Judge  commit  him  to  the  custody  of  an  officer  of  the  Court  for  any  term  not 
exceeding seven days, unless in the meantime, such person consents to be examined and to answer, or to produce the 
document or thing and in the event of his persisting in his refusal, he may be dealt with according to the provisions 
of section 345 or section 346. 

350. Summary procedure for punishment for non-attendance by a witness in obedience to summons.—(1) 
If any witness being summoned to appear before a Criminal Court is legally bound to appear at a certain place and 
time  in  obedience  to  the  summons  and  without  just  excuse  neglects  or  refuses  to  attend  at  that  place  or  time  or 
departs from the place where he has to attend before the time at which it is lawful for him to depart, and the Court 
before  which  the  witness  is  to  appear  is  satisfied  that  it  is  expedient  in  the  interest  of  justice  that  such  a  witness 
should  be  tried  summarily,  the  Court  may  take  cognizance  of  the  offence  and  after  giving  the  offender  an 
opportunity of showing cause why he should not be punished under this section, sentence him to fine not exceeding 
one hundred rupees. 

(2) In every such case the Court shall follow, as nearly as may be practicable, the procedure prescribed for 

summary trials. 

351.  Appeals  from  convictions  under  sections  344,  345,  349  and  350.—(1)  Any  person  sentenced  by  any 
Court  other  than  a  High  Court  under  section  344,  section  345,  section  349,  or  section  350  may,  notwithstanding 
anything contained in this Code appeal to the Court  to  which decrees or orders  made in  such  Court are ordinarily 
appealable. 

(2) The provisions of Chapter XXIX shall, so far as they are applicable, apply to appeals under this section, and

Court) or Magistrate shall try any person for any offence referred to in section 195, when such offence is committed 
before  himself  or  in  contempt  of  his  authority,  or  is  brought  under  his  notice  as  such  Judge  or  Magistrate  in  the 
course of a judicial proceeding. 

CHAPTER XXVII

subsequent time of which notice shall be given to the parties or their pleaders,— 

(a) by delivering the whole of the judgment; or 

(b) by reading out the whole of the judgment; or  

(c)  by  reading  out  the  operative  part  of  the  judgment  and  explaining  the  substance  of  the  judgment  in  a 

language which is understood by the accused or his pleader. 

(2) Where the judgment is delivered under clause (a) of sub-section (1), the presiding officer shall cause it to be 
taken down in short-hand, sign the transcript and every page thereof as soon as it is made ready, and write on it the 
date of the delivery of the judgment in open Court. 

154 
 

(3) Where the judgment or the operative part thereof is read out under clause (b) or clause (c) of sub-section (1), 
as the case may be, it shall be dated and signed by the presiding officer in open Court, and if it is not written with his 
own hand, every page of the judgment shall be signed by him. 

(4)  Where  the  judgment  is  pronounced  in  the  manner  specified  in  clause  (c)  of  sub-section  (1),  the  whole

(5) If the accused is in custody, he shall be brought up to hear the judgment pronounced. 

(6) If the accused is not in custody, he shall be required by the Court to attend to hear the judgment pronounced,

he is acquitted: 

Provided that, where there are more accused than one, and one or more of them do not attend the Court on the 
date  on  which  the  judgment  is  to  be  pronounced,  the  presiding  officer  may,  in  order  to  avoid  undue  delay  in  the 
disposal of the case, pronounce the judgment notwithstanding their absence. 

 (7) No judgment delivered by any Criminal Court shall be deemed to be invalid by reason only of the absence 
of any party or his pleader on the day or from the place notified for the delivery thereof, or of any omission to serve, 
or defect in serving, on the parties or their pleaders, or any of them, the notice of such day and place. 

(8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit in any way the extent of the provisions of section 465.

twenty-one  years  of  age  is  convicted  of  an  offence  punishable  with  fine  only  or  with  imprisonment  for  a  term  of 
seven years or less, or when any person under twenty-one years of age or any woman is convicted of an offence not 
punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life,  and  no  previous  conviction  is  proved  against  the  offender,  if  it 
appears  to  the  Court  before  which  he  is  convicted,  regard  being  had  to  the  age,  character  or  antecedents  of  the 
offender, and to the circumstances in which the offence was committed, that it is expedient that  the  offender should 
be  released  on  probation  of  good  conduct,    the  Court  may,  instead  of  sentencing  him  at  once  to  any  punishment, 
direct that he be released on his entering into a bond, with or without sureties, to appear and receive sentence when 
called upon during such period (not exceeding three years) as the Court may direct, and in the meantime to keep the 
peace and be of good behaviour: 

Provided that where any first offender is convicted by a Magistrate of the second class not specially empowered 
by the High Court, and the Magistrate is of opinion that the powers conferred by this section should be exercised, he 
shall record his opinion to that effect, and submit the proceedings to a Magistrate of the first class, forwarding the 
accused to, or taking bail  for  his appearance before, such  Magistrate,  who shall dispose of the case  in the  manner 
provided by sub-section (2). 

(2) Where proceedings are submitted to a Magistrate of the first class as provided by sub-section (1), such Magistrate 
may thereupon pass such sentence or make such order as he might have passed or made if the case had originally been 
heard by  him, and, if  he thinks further inquiry or additional evidence on any point to be  necessary,  he  may  make  such 
inquiry or take such evidence himself or direct such inquiry or evidence to be made or taken.

or any offence under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), punishable with not more than two years, imprisonment or 
any offence punishable with fine only and no previous conviction is proved against him, the Court before which he 
is so convicted may, if it thinks fit, having regard to the age, character,  antecedents or physical or mental condition 
of the offender and to the trivial nature of the offence or any extenuating circumstances under which the offence was 
committed, instead of sentencing him to any punishment, release him after due admonition. 

(4) An order under this section may be made by any Appellate Court or by the High Court or Court of Session 

when exercising its powers of revision. 

(5)  When  an  order  has  been  made  under  this  section  in  respect  of  any  offender,  the  High  Court  or  Court  of 
Session may, on appeal when there is a right of appeal to such Court, or when exercising its powers of revision, set 
aside such order, and in lieu thereof pass sentence on such offender according to law: 

Provided that the High Court or Court of Session shall  not under this sub-section inflict  a greater punishment 

than might have been inflicted by the Court by which the offender was convicted. 

(6) The provisions of sections 121, 124 and 373 shall, so far as may be, apply in the case of sureties offered in

offender or his surety (if any) has a fixed place of abode or regular occupation in the place for which the Court acts 
or in which the offender is likely to live during the period named for the observance of the conditions. 

 (8) If the Court which convicted the offender, or a Court which could have dealt with the offender in respect of 
his original offence, is satisfied that the offender has failed to observe any of the conditions of his recognizance, it 
may issue a warrant for his apprehension. 

(9) An offender, when apprehended on any such warrant, shall be brought forthwith before the Court issuing the 
warrant,  and  such  Court  may  either  remand  him  in  custody  until  the  case  is  heard  or  admit  him  to  bail  with  a 
sufficient  surety  conditioned  on  his  appearing  for  sentence  and  such  Court  may,  after  hearing  the  case,  pass 
sentence. 

(10) Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 (20 of 1958), or 
the  Children  Act,  1960  (60  of  1960)  or  any  other  law  for  the  time  being  in  force  for  the  treatment,  training  or 
rehabilitation of youthful offenders.

362. Court not to alter judgment.—Save as otherwise provided by this Code or by any other law for the time

(2) On the application of the accused, a certified copy of the judgment, or when he so desires, a translation in 
his own language if practicable or in the language of the Court, shall be given to him without delay, and such copy

Provided  that  where  a  sentence  of  death  is  passed  or  confirmed  by  the  High  Court,  a  certified  copy  of  the 

judgment shall be immediately given to the accused free of cost whether or not he applies for the same. 

(3)  The  provisions  of  sub-section  (2)  shall  apply  in  relation  to  an  order  under  section  117  as  they  apply  in

Criminal  Court  shall,  on  an  application  made  in  this  behalf  and  on  payment  of  the  prescribed  charges,  be  given  a 
copy of such judgment or order or of any deposition or other part of the record: 

Provided that the Court may, if it thinks fit for some special reason, give it to him free of cost. 

(6) The High Court may, by rules, provide for the grant of copies of any judgment or order of a Criminal Court

sentence under appeal. 

387. Judgments of Subordinate Appellate Court.—The rules contained in Chapter XXVII as to the judgment 
of a Criminal Court of original jurisdiction shall apply, so far as may be practicable, to the judgment in appeal of a

(ii) where the offence of which such person has been convicted is a bailable one, and he is on bail,

will afford sufficient time to present the appeal and obtain the orders of the Appellate Court under sub-section (1); and 
the sentence of imprisonment shall, so long as he is so released on bail, be deemed to be suspended. 

(4) When the appellant is ultimately sentenced to imprisonment for a term or to imprisonment for life, the time 

during which he is so released shall be excluded in computing the term for which he is so sentenced. 

390. Arrest of accused in appeal from acquittal.—When an appeal is presented under section 378, the High

under this Chapter, the Appellate Court, if it thinks additional evidence to be necessary, shall record its reasons and 
may either take such evidence itself, or direct it to be taken by a Magistrate  or, when the Appellate Court is a High 
Court, by a Court of Session or a Magistrate.

evidence to the Appellate Court, and such Court shall thereupon proceed to dispose of the appeal.

(4) The taking of evidence under this section shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter XXIII, as if it were an 

inquiry. 

392. Procedure where Judges of Court of Appeal are equally divided.—When an appeal under this Chapter 
is heard by a High Court before a Bench of Judges and they are divided in opinion, the appeal, with their opinions, 
shall be laid before another Judge of that Court, and that Judge, after such hearing as he thinks fit, shall deliver his 
opinion, and the judgment or order shall follow that opinion: 

Provided  that  if  one  of  the  Judges  constituting  the  Bench,  or,  where  the  appeal  is  laid  before  another  Judge

395.  Reference  to  High  Court.—(1)  Where  any  Court  is  satisfied  that  a  case  pending  before  it  involves  a 
question as to the validity of any Act, Ordinance or Regulation or of any provision contained  in an  Act, Ordinance 
or Regulation, the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case, and is of opinion that such Act, 
Ordinance,  Regulation  or  provision  is  invalid  or  inoperative,  but  has  not  been  so  declared  by  the  High  Court  to 
which that Court is Subordinate or by the Supreme Court, the Court shall state a case setting out its opinion and the 
reasons therefor, and refer the same for the decision of the High Court. 

Explanation.—In this section, “Regulation” means any Regulation as defined in the General Clauses Act, 1897 

(10 of 1897), or in the General Clauses Act of a State. 

(2) A Court of Session or a Metropolitan Magistrate may, if it or he thinks fit in any case pending before it or 
him to which the provisions of sub-section (1) do not apply, refer for the decision of the High Court any question of 
law arising in the hearing of such case. 

(3) Any Court making a reference to the High Court under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) may, pending the 
decision of the High Court thereon, either commit the accused to jail or release him on bail to appear when called 
upon. 

396. Disposal of case according to decision of High Court.—(1) When a question has been so referred, the 
High Court shall pass such order thereon as it thinks fit, and shall cause a copy of such order to be sent to the Court 
by which the reference was made, which shall dispose of the case conformably to the said order. 

(2) The High Court may direct by whom the costs of such reference shall be paid. 

397. Calling for records to exercise powers of revision.—(1) The High Court or any Sessions Judge may call 
for  and  examine  the  record  of  any  proceeding  before  any  inferior  Criminal  Court  situate  within  its  or  his  local 
jurisdiction  for  the  purpose  of  satisfying  itself  or  himself;  to  the  correctness,  legality  or  propriety  of  any  finding, 
sentence or order, recorded or passed, and as to the regularity of any proceedings of such inferior Court, and may, 
when calling, for such record, direct that the execution of any sentence or order be suspended, and if the accused is 
in confinement that he be released on bail or on his own bond pending the examination of the record. 

Explanation.—All  Magistrates,  whether  Executive  or  Judicial,  and  whether  exercising  original  or  appellate 

jurisdiction,  shall  be  deemed  to  be  inferior  to  the  Sessions  Judge  for  the  purposes  of  this  sub-section  and  of              
section 398. 

(2) The powers of revision conferred by sub-section (1) shall not be exercised in relation to any interlocutory 

order passed in any appeal, inquiry, trial or other proceeding.

Judge, no further application by the same person shall be entertained by the other of them.

Sessions Judge may direct the Chief Judicial Magistrate by himself or by any of the Magistrates subordinate to him

inquiry into any complaint which has been dismissed under section 203 or sub-section (4) of section 204, or into the 
case of any person accused of an offence who has been discharged: 

Provided that no Court shall make any direction under this section for inquiry into the case of any person who 
has been discharged unless such person has had an opportunity of showing cause why such direction should not be 
made.

called for by himself, the Sessions Judge may exercise all or any of the powers which may be exercised by the High 

170 
 

Court under sub-section (1) of section 401.

provisions of sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of section 401 shall, so far as may be, apply to such proceeding and 
references in the said sub-sections to the High Court shall be construed as references to the Sessions Judge. 

(3)  Where  any  application  for  revision  is  made  by  or  on  behalf  of  any  person  before  the  Sessions  Judge,  the 
decision of the Sessions Judge thereon in relation to such person shall be final and no further proceeding by way of 
revision at the instance of such person shall be entertained by the High Court or any other Court.

and, when the Judges composing the Court of Revision are equally divided in opinion, the case shall be disposed of 
in the manner provided by section 392. 

(2)  No order under this section shall be made to the prejudice of the accused or other person unless he has had 

an opportunity of being heard either personally or by pleader in his own defence. 

 (3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to authorise a High Court to convert a finding of acquittal into one 

conviction. 

(4) Where under this Code an appeal lies and no appeal is brought, no proceeding by way of revision shall be 

entertained at the instance of the party who could have appealed. 

(5) Where under this Code an appeal lies but an application for revision  has been  made to the High Court by 
any person and the High Court is satisfied that such application was made under the erroneous belief that no appeal 
lies thereto and that it is necessary in the interests of Justice so to do, the High Court may treat the application for 
revision as a petition of appeal and deal with the same accordingly. 

402.  Power  of  High  Court  to  withdraw  or  transfer  revision  cases.—(1)  Whenever  one  or  more  persons 
convicted at the same trial makes or make application to a High Court for revision and any  other person  convicted at 
the same trial makes an  application to the Sessions Judge for revision, the High Court shall decide, having regard to the 
general  convenience    of  the    parties  and  the  importance  of  the  questions  involved,  which  of  the  two  Courts    should  
finally dispose of the applications for revision and  when the High Court decides that all the applications for revision 
should  be  disposed  of  by    itself,  the  High  Court  shall  direct  that  the  applications  for  revision    pending  before  the  
Sessions Judge be transferred to itself and where the High Court decides that it is not necessary for it to dispose of the 
applications for revision, it shall direct that the applications for revision made to it be transferred to the Sessions Judge. 

(2) Whenever any application for revision is transferred to the High Court,  that Court shall deal with the same 

as if it were an application duly made before itself. 

(3)  Whenever  any  application  for  revision  is  transferred  to  the  Sessions  Judge,  that  Judge  shall  deal  with  the 

same as if it were an application duly made before himself. 

(4)  Where  an  application  for  revision  is  transferred  by  the  High  Court  to  the  Sessions  Judge,  no  further 
application  for  revision  shall  lie  to  the  High  Court  or  to  any  other  Court  at  the  instance  of  the  person  or  persons 
whose applications for revision have been disposed of by the Sessions Judge. 

403. Option of Court to hear parties.—Save as otherwise expressly provided by this Code, no party has any 
right to be heard either personally or by pleader before any Court exercising its powers of revision; but the  Court 
may, if it thinks fit, when exercising such powers, hear any party either personally or by pleader. 

171 
 

404. Statement by Metropolitan Magistrate of grounds of his decision to be considered by High Court.—
When the record of any trial held by a Metropolitan Magistrate is called for by the High Court or Court of Session 
under section 397, the Magistrate may submit with the record a statement setting forth the grounds of his decision or 
order  and  any  facts  which  he  thinks  material  to  the  issue,  and  that  Court  shall  consider  such  statement  before 
overruling or setting aside the said decision or order. 

405. High Court's order to be certified to lower Court.—When a case is revised under this Chapter by the 
High Court or a Sessions Judge, it or he shall, in the manner provided by section 388, certify its decision or order to 
the  Court  by  which  the  finding,  sentence  or  order  revised  was  recorded  or  passed,  and  the  Court  to  which  the 
decision or order is so certified shall thereupon   make such orders as are conformable to the decision so certified, 
and, if necessary, the record shall be amended in accordance therewith.

application. 

 (6) Where the application  is  for the transfer of a case or appeal from any Subordinate  Court, the High  Court

fine only and to imprisonment in default of payment of the fine, and the fine is not paid forthwith, the Court may— 

(a) order that the fine shall be payable either in full on or before a date not more than thirty days from the 
date of the order, or in two or three instalments, of which the first shall be payable on or before a date not more 
than thirty days from the date of the order and the other or others at an interval or at intervals, as the case may 
be, of not more than thirty days; 

(b) suspend the execution of the sentence of imprisonment and release the offender, on the execution by the 
offender of a bond, with or without sureties, as the Court thinks fit, conditioned for his appearance before the 
Court on the date or dates on or before which payment of the fine or the instalments thereof, as the case may be, 

176 
 

is to be made; and if the amount of the fine or of any instalment, as the case may be, is not realised on or before 
the latest date on which it is payable under the order, the Court may direct the sentence of imprisonment to be 
carried into execution at once. 

(2) The provisions of sub-section (1) shall be applicable also in any case in which an order for the payment of 
money  has  been  made  on  non-recovery  of  which  imprisonment  may  be  awarded  and  the  money  is  not  paid 
forthwith; and, if the person against whom the order has been made, on being required to enter into a bond such as is 
referred to in that sub-section, fails to do so, the Court may at once pass sentence of imprisonment. 

D.—General provisions regarding execution 

425.  Who  may  issue  warrant.—Every  warrant  for  the  execution  of  a  sentence  may  be  issued  either  by  the 

Judge or Magistrate who passed the sentence, or by his successor-in-office. 

426. Sentence on escaped convict when to take effect.—(1) When a sentence of death, imprisonment for life 
or fine is passed under this Code on an escaped convict, such sentence shall, subject to the provisions hereinbefore 
contained, take effect immediately. 

(2) When a sentence of imprisonment for a term is passed under this Code on an escaped convict,— 

(a)  if  such  sentence  is  severer  in  kind  than  the  sentence  which  such  convict  was  undergoing  when  he 

escaped, the new sentence shall take effect immediately; 

(b) if such sentence is not severer in kind than the sentence which such convict was undergoing when he 
escaped, the new sentence shall take effect after he has suffered imprisonment for a further period equal to that 
which, at the time of his escape, remained unexpired of his former sentence. 

(3) For the purposes of sub-section (2), a sentence of rigorous imprisonment shall be deemed to be severer in 

kind than a sentence of simple imprisonment. 

427. Sentence on offender already sentenced for another offence.—(1) When a person already undergoing a 
sentence of imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent conviction to imprisonment or imprisonment for life, such 
imprisonment or imprisonment for life shall commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he has been 
previously sentenced, unless the Court directs that the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with such previous 
sentence: 

Provided that where a person who has been sentenced to imprisonment by an order under section 122 in default 
of  furnishing  security  is,  whilst  undergoing  such  sentence,  sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  an  offence  committed 
prior to the making of such order, the latter sentence shall commence immediately. 

(2)  When  a  person  already  undergoing  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  for  life  is  sentenced  on  a  subsequent 
conviction to imprisonment for a term or imprisonment for life, the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with 
such previous sentence. 

428. Period of detention undergone by the accused to be set off against the sentence of imprisonment.— 
Where an accused person has, on conviction, been sentenced to imprisonment for a term,  1[, not being imprisonment 
in default of payment of fine], the period of detention, if any, undergone by him during the  investigation, inquiry or 
trial  of  the  same  case  and  before  the  date  of  such  conviction,  shall  be  set  off  against  the  term  of  imprisonment 
imposed on  him on such conviction, and the  liability of such person to undergo imprisonment on  such conviction 
shall be restricted to the remainder, if any, of the term of imprisonment imposed on him: 

2[Provided that in cases referred to in section 433A, such period of detention shall be set off against the period 

of fourteen years referred to in that section.] 

                                                 
1. Ins. by Act 45 of 1978, s. 31  (w.e.f.18-12-1978).

177 
 

429. Saving.—(1) Nothing in section 426 or section 427 shall be held to excuse any person from any part of the 

punishment to which he is liable upon his former or subsequent conviction. 

(2)  When  an  award  of  imprisonment  in  default  of  payment  of  a  fine  is  annexed  to  a  substantive  sentence  of 
imprisonment and the person undergoing the sentence is after its execution to undergo a further substantive sentence 
or further substantive sentences of imprisonment, effect shall not be given to the award of imprisonment in default 
of payment of the fine until the person has undergone the further sentence or sentences. 

430.  Return  of  warrant  on  execution  of  sentence.—When  a  sentence  has  been  fully  executed,  the  officer 
executing  it  shall  return  the  warrant  to  the  Court  from  which  it  is  issued,  with  an  endorsement  under  his  hand 
certifying the manner in which the sentence has been executed. 

431. Money ordered to be paid recoverable as a fine.—Any money (other than a fine) payable by virtue of 
any order made under this Code, and the method of recovery of which is not otherwise expressly provided for, shall 
be recoverable as if it were a fine: 

Provided  that  section  421  shall,  in  its  application  to  an  order  under  section  359,  by  virtue  of  this  section,  be 
construed as if in the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 421, after the words and figures “under section 357”, the 
words and figures “or an order for payment of costs under section 359” had been inserted. 

E.—Suspension, remission and commutation of sentences 

432. Power to suspend or remit  sentences.—(1) When any person has been sentenced to punishment  for an 
offence, the appropriate Government may, at any time, without conditions or upon any conditions which the person 
sentenced accepts, suspend the execution of his sentence or remit the whole or any part of the punishment to which 
he has been sentenced. 

(2)  Whenever  an  application  is  made  to  the  appropriate  Government  for  the  suspension  or  remission  of  a 
sentence,  the  appropriate  Government  may  require  the  presiding  Judge  of  the  Court  before  or  by  which  the 
conviction  was  had  or  confirmed,  to  state  his  opinion  as  to  whether  the  application  should  be  granted  or  refused, 
together with his reasons for such opinion and also to forward with the statement of such opinion a certified copy of 
the record of the trial or of such record thereof as exists. 

(3) If any condition on  which a sentence  has been suspended or remitted is, in the opinion of the appropriate 
Government, not fulfilled, the appropriate Government may cancel the suspension or remission, and thereupon the 
person  in  whose  favour  the  sentence  has  been  suspended  or  remitted  may,  if  at  large,  be  arrested  by  any  police 
officer, without warrant and remanded to undergo the unexpired portion of the sentence. 

(4) The condition on which a sentence is suspended or remitted under this section may be one to be fulfilled by 

the person in whose favour the sentence is suspended or remitted, or one independent of his will. 

(5) The appropriate Government may, by general rules or special orders, give directions as to the suspension of 

sentences and the conditions on which petitions should be presented and dealt with: 

Provided that in the case of any sentence (other than a sentence of fine) passed on a male person above the age 
of eighteen years, no such petition by the person sentenced or by any other person on his behalf shall be entertained, 
unless the person sentenced is in jail, and— 

(a) where such petition is made by the person sentenced, it is presented through the officer in charge of the 

jail; or

(b) where such petition is made by any other person, it contains a declaration that the person sentenced is in

section of this Code or of any other law, which restricts the liberty of any person or imposes any liability upon him 
or his property.

(d) a sentence of simple imprisonment, for fine. 

1[433A.  Restriction  on  powers  of  remission  or  commutation  in  certain  cases.—Notwithstanding  anything 
contained  in  section  432,  where  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  for  life  is  imposed  on  conviction  of  a  person  for  an 
offence  for  which  death  is  one  of  the  punishments  provided  by  law,  or  where  a  sentence  of  death  imposed  on  a 
person has been commuted under section 433 into one of imprisonment  for life,  such person shall  not be released 
from prison unless he had served at least fourteen years of imprisonment.] 

434.  Concurrent  power  of  Central  Government  in  case  of  death  sentences.—The  powers  conferred  by 
sections 432 and 433 upon the State Government  may, in the case of sentences of death, also be exercised by the

CHAPTER XXXIII 

PROVISIONS AS TO BAIL AND BONDS 

436.  In  what  cases  bail  to  be  taken.—(1)  When  any  person  other  than  a  person  accused  of  a  non-bailable 
offence is arrested or detained without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station, or appears or is brought 
before a Court, and is prepared at any  time  while in the custody of such officer or at any stage of  the proceeding 
before such Court to give bail, such person shall be released on bail: 

Provided  that  such  officer  or  Court,  if  he  or  it  thinks  fit,  1[may,  and  shall,  if  such  person  is  indigent  and  is 
unable  to  furnish  surety,  instead  of  taking  bail]  from  such  person,  discharge  him  on  his  executing  a  bond  without 
sureties for his appearance as hereinafter provided. 

2[Explanation.—Where  a  person  is  unable  to  give  bail  within  a  week  of  the  date  of  his  arrest,  it  shall  be  a 
sufficient  ground  for  the  officer  or  the  Court  to  presume  that  he  is  an  indigent  person  for  the  purposes  of  this 
proviso:] 

Provided  further  that  nothing  in  this  section  shall  be  deemed  to  affect  the  provisions  of  sub-section  (3)  of 

section 116 3[or section 446A]. 

(2)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  sub-section  (1),  where  a  person  has  failed  to  comply  with  the 
conditions of the bail-bond as regards the time and place of attendance, the Court may refuse to release him on bail, 
when on a subsequent occasion in the same case he appears before the Court or is brought in custody and any such 
refusal shall be without prejudice to the powers of the Court to call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the 
penalty thereof under section 446. 

4[436A. Maximum period for which an undertrial prisoner can be detained.—Where a person has, during 
the period of investigation, inquiry or trial under this  Code of an offence  under any law (not being an offence  for 
which the punishment of death has been specified as one of the punishments under that law) undergone detention for 
a period extending up to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offence under that law, 
he shall be released by the Court on his personal bond with or without sureties: 

Provided that the Court may, after hearing the Public Prosecutor and for reasons to be recorded by it in writing, 
order the continued detention of such person for a period longer than one-half of the said period or release him on 
bail instead of the personal bond with or without sureties: 

Provided further that no such person shall in any case be detained during the period of investigation, inquiry or 

trial for more than the maximum period of imprisonment provided for the said offence under that law. 

Explanation.—In computing the period of detention under this section for granting bail, the period of detention 

passed due to delay in proceeding caused by the accused shall be excluded.] 

437.  When  bail  may  be  taken  in  case  of  non-bailable  offence.—5[(1)  When  any  person  accused  of,  or 
suspected  of,  the  commission  of  any  non-bailable  offence  is  arrested  or  detained  without  warrant  by  an  officer  in 
charge of a police station or appears or is brought before a Court other than the High Court or Court of session, he 
may be released on bail, but— 

(i)  such  person  shall  not  be  so  released  if  there  appear  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  he  has  been 

guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life; 

(ii) such person shall not be so released if such offence is a cognizable offence and he had been previously 
convicted of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for seven years or more,

Provided that the Court may direct that a person referred to in clause (i) or clause (ii) be released on bail if such 

person is under the age of sixteen years or is a woman or is sick or infirm: 

Provided further that the Court may also direct that a person referred to in clause  (ii) be released on bail if it is 

satisfied that it is just and proper so to do for any other special reason: 

Provided also that the mere fact that an accused person may be required for being identified by witnesses during 
investigation shall not be sufficient ground for refusing to grant bail if he is otherwise entitled to be released on bail 
and gives an undertaking that he shall comply with such directions as may be given by the Court:] 

2[Provided also that no person shall, if the offence alleged to have been committed by him is punishable with 
death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or more, be released on bail by the Court under this 
sub-section without giving an opportunity of hearing to the Public Prosecutor.] 

(2) If it appears to such officer or Court at any stage of the investigation, inquiry or trial, as the case may be, 
that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the accused has committed a non-bailable offence, but that 
there are sufficient grounds for further inquiry into his guilt,  3[the accused shall, subject to the provisions of section 
446A and pending such inquiry, be released on bail], or, at the discretion of such officer or Court, on the execution 
by him of a bond without sureties for his appearance as hereinafter provided.

may extend to seven years or more or of an offence under Chapter VI, Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the Indian 
Penal Code (45 of 1860) or abatement of, or conspiracy or attempt to commit, any such offence, is released on bail 
under sub-section (1), 4[the Court shall impose the conditions,— 

(a) that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed under this Chapter, 

(b) that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused, or suspected, 

of the commission of which he is suspected, and 

(c) that such person shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person 
acquainted  with  the  facts  of  the  case  so  as  to  dissuade  him  from  disclosing  such  facts  to  the  Court  or  to  any 
police officer or tamper with the evidence, 

and may also impose, in the interests of justice, such other conditions as it considers necessary.] 

(4) An officer or a Court releasing any person on  bail under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), shall record in 

writing his or its 5[reasons or special reasons] for so doing. 

(5) Any Court which has released a person on bail under sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), may, if it considers 

it necessary so to do, direct that such person be arrested and commit him to custody. 

(6)  If,  in  any  case  triable  by  a  Magistrate,  the  trial  of  a  person  accused  of  any  non-bailable  offence  is  not 

concluded within a period of sixty days from the first date fixed for taking evidence in the case, such person shall, if 

he is in custody during the whole of the said period, be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, unless 

for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Magistrate otherwise directs.

181 
 

(7)  If,  at  any  time,  after  the  conclusion  of  the  trial  of  a  person  accused  of  a  non-bailable  offence  and  before 

judgment is delivered, the Court is of opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not 

guilty of any such offence, it shall release the accused, if he is in custody, on the execution by him of a bond without 

sureties for his appearance to hear judgment delivered.  

1[437A. Bail to require accused to appear before next appellate Court.—(1) Before conclusion of the trial 

and  before  disposal  of  the  appeal,  the  Court  trying  the  offence  or  the  Appellate  Court,  as  the  case  may  be,  shall  

require the accused to execute bail bonds with sureties, to appear before the higher Court as and when such Court 

issues  notice  in  respect  of  any  appeal  or  petition  filed  against  the  judgment  of  the  respective  Court  and  such  bail 

bonds shall be in force for six months. 

(2) If such accused fails to appear, the bond stand forfeited and the procedure under section 446 shall apply.]  

438. Direction for grant of bail to person apprehending arrest.—(1) When any person has reason to believe 

that  he  may  be  arrested  on  an  accusation  of  having  committed  a  non-bailable  offence,  he  may  apply  to  the  High 

Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section; and that Court may, if it thinks fit, direct that in the 

event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail. 

(2) When the High Court or the Court of Session makes a direction under sub-section (1), it may include such 

conditions in such directions in the light of the facts of the particular case, as it may think fit, including— 

(i) a condition that the person shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when 

required; 

to any police officer;

accusation, and is prepared either at the time of arrest or at any time while in the custody of such officer to give bail, 

he shall be released on bail; and if a Magistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that a warrant should be 

issued in the first instance against that person, he shall issue a bailable warrant in confirmity with the direction of the 

Court under sub-section (1).

committed an offence under sub-section (3) of section 376 or section 376AB or section 376DA or section 376DB of 

the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860).]

  CHAPTER XXXIV 

DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY 

451.  Order  for  custody  and  disposal  of  property  pending  trial  in  certain  cases.—When  any  property  is 
produced before any Criminal Court during any inquiry or trial, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for 
the proper custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry or trial, and, if the property is subject to 
speedy and natural decay, or if it is otherwise expedient so to do, the Court may, after recording such evidence as it 
thinks necessary, order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of. 

Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, “property” includes— 

(a) property of any kind or document which is produced before the Court or which is in its custody; 

(b)  any  property  regarding  which  an  offence  appears  to  have  been  committed  or  which  appears  to  have 

been used for the commission of any offence. 

452. Order for disposal of property at conclusion of trial.—(1) When an inquiry or trial in any  Criminal 
Court is concluded, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal, by destruction, confiscation or 
delivery  to  any  person  claiming  to  be  entitled  to  possession  thereof  or  otherwise,  of  any  property  or  document 
produced before it or in its custody, or regarding which any offence appears to have been committed, or which has 
been used for the commission of any offence. 

(2) An order may be made under sub-section (1) for the delivery of any property to any person claiming to be 
entitled  to  the  possession  thereof,  without  any  condition  or  on  condition  that  he  executes  a  bond,  with  or  without 
securities,  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  Court,  engaging  to  restore  such  property  to  the  Court  if  the  order  made  under 
sub-section (1) is modified or set aside on appeal or revision. 

(3) A Court of Session  may,  instead of itself  making an order under sub-section  (1), direct the property  to be 
delivered to the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who shall thereupon deal with it in the manner provided in sections 457, 
458 and 459. 

(4) Except where the property is livestock or is subject to speedy and natural decay, or where a bond has been 
executed  in  pursuance  of  sub-section  (2),  an  order  made  under  sub-section  (1)  shall  not  be  carried  out  for  two 
months, or when an appeal is presented, until such appeal has been disposed of. 

(5) In this section, the term “property” includes, in the case of property regarding which an offence appears to 
have  been  committed,  not  only  such  property  as  has  been  originally  in  the  possession  or  under  the  control  of  any 
party,  but  also  any  property  into  or  for  which  the  same  may  have  been  converted  or  exchanged,  and  anything 
acquired by such conversion or exchange, whether immediately or otherwise. 

453.  Payment  to  innocent  purchaser  of  money  found  on  accused.—When  any  person  is  convicted  of  any 
offence  which  includes,  or  amounts  to,  theft  or  receiving  stolen  property,  and  it  is  proved  that  any  other  person 
bought the  stolen property  from him  without  knowing  or having reason  to believe  that the same  was stolen, and 
that  any  money  has  on  his  arrest  been  taken  out  of  the  possession  of  the  convicted  person,  the  Court  may,  on  the 
application  of  such  purchaser  and  on  the  restitution  of  the  stolen  property  to  the  person  entitled  to  the  possession 
thereof, order that out of such money a sum not exceeding the price paid by such purchaser be delivered to him. 

454. Appeal against orders under section 452 or section 453.—(1) Any person aggrieved by an order made 
by a Court under section 452 or section 453, may appeal against it to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from 
convictions by the former Court. 

(2)  On  such  appeal,  the  Appellate  Court  may  direct  the  order  to  be  stayed  pending  disposal  of  the  appeal,  or 

may modify, alter or annul the order and make any further orders that may be just. 

(3)  The  powers  referred  to  in  sub-section  (2)  may  also  be  exercised  by  a  Court  of  appeal,  confirmation  or 

revision while dealing with the case in which the order referred to in sub-section (1) was made. 

455. Destruction of libellous and other matter.—(1) On a conviction under section 292, section 293, section 
501 or section 502 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), the Court may order the destruction of all the copies of the 

188 
 

thing  in  respect  of  which  the  conviction  was  had,  and  which  are  in  the  custody  of  the  Court  or  remain  in  the 
possession or power of the person convicted. 

(2) The Court may, in like manner, on a conviction under section 272, section 273, section 274 or section 275 of 
the  Indian  Penal  Code  (45  of  1860),  order  the  food,  drink,  drug  or  medical  preparation  in  respect  of  which  the 
conviction was had, to be destroyed. 

456.  Power  to  restore  possession  of  immovable  property.—(1)  When  a  person  is  convicted  of  an  offence 
attended  by  criminal  force  or  show  of  force  or  by  criminal  intimidation,  and  it  appears  to  the  Court  that,  by  such 
force or show of force or intimidation, any person has been dispossessed of any immovable property, the Court may, 
if it thinks fit, order that possession of the same be restored to that person after evicting by force, if necessary, any 
other person who may be in possession of the property: 

Provided that no such order shall be made by the Court more than one month after the date of the conviction. 

(2)  Where  the  Court  trying  the  offence  has  not  made  an  order  under  sub-section  (1),  the  Court  of  appeal, 
confirmation or revision may, if it thinks fit, make such order while disposing of the appeal, reference or revision, as 
the case may be. 

(3) Where an order has been made under sub-section (1), the provisions of section 454 shall apply in relation 

thereto as they apply in relation to an order under section 453. 

(4)  No  order  made  under    this  section  shall  prejudice  any  right  or  interest  to  or  in  such  immovable  property 

which any person may be able to establish in a civil suit. 

457.  Procedure  by  police  upon  seizure  of  property.—(1)  Whenever  the  seizure  of  property  by  any  police 
officer  is  reported  to  a  Magistrate  under  the  provisions  of  this  Code,  and  such  property  is  not  produced  before  a 
Criminal Court during an inquiry or trial, the Magistrate may make such order as he thinks fit respecting the disposal 
of such property or the delivery of such property to the person entitled to the possession thereof, or if such person 
cannot be ascertained, respecting the custody and production of such property. 

(2)  If  the  person  so  entitled  is  known,  the  Magistrate  may  order  the  property  to  be  delivered  to  him  on  such 
conditions (if any) as the Magistrate thinks fit and if such person is unknown, the Magistrate may detain it and shall, 
in such case, issue a proclamation specifying the articles of which such property consists, and requiring any person 
who may have a claim thereto, to appear before him and establish his claim within six months from the date of such 
proclamation. 

458.  Procedure  where  no  claimant  appears  within  six  months.—(1)  If  no  person  within  such  period 
establishes his claim to such property, and if the person in whose possession such property was found is unable to 
show  that  it  was  legally  acquired  by  him,  the  Magistrate  may    by  order  direct  that  such  property  shall  be  at  the 
disposal of the State Government  and may be sold by that Government and the proceeds of such sale shall be dealt 
with in such manner as may be prescribed. 

(2) An appeal shall lie against any such order to the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from convictions by 

the Magistrate. 

459. Power to sell perishable property.—If the person entitled to the possession of such property is unknown 
or absent and the property is subject to speedy and natural decay, or if the Magistrate to whom its seizure is reported 
is of opinion that its sale would be for the benefit of the owner, or that the value of such property is  1[less than five 
hundred  rupees],  the  Magistrate  may  at  any  time  direct  it  to  be  sold;  and  the  provisions  of  sections  457  and  458 
shall, as nearly as may be practicable, apply to the net proceeds of such sale. 

460. Irregularities which do not vitiate proceedings.—If any Magistrate not empowered by law to do any of

merely on the ground that the inquiry, trial or other proceedings in the course of which it was arrived at or passed, 
took place in a wrong sessions division, district, sub-division or other local area, unless it appears that such error has 
in fact occasioned a failure of justice.  

463.  Non-compliance  with  provisions  of  section  164  or  section  281.—(1)  If  any  Court  before  which  a

(2) In determining whether any error, omission or irregularity in any proceeding under this Code, or any error,      

or irregularity in any sanction for the prosecution has occasioned a failure of justice, the Court shall have regard to

instance or in a Court of appeal or revision, against the offender, shall be excluded: 

Provided  that  no  such  exclusion  shall  be  made  unless  the  prosecution  relates  to  the  same  facts  and  is 
prosecuted in good faith in a Court which from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable 
to entertain it. 

(2) Where the institution of the prosecution in respect of an offence has been stayed by an injunction or 
order, then, in computing the period of limitation, the period of the continuance of the injunction or order, the 
day on which it was issued or made, and the day on which it was withdrawn, shall be excluded. 

(3) Where notice of prosecution for an offence has been given, or where, under any law for the time being  
in  force,  the  previous  consent  or  sanction  of  the  Government  or  any  other  authority  is  required  for  the 
institution  of  any  prosecution  for  an  offence,  then,  in  computing  the  period  of  limitation,  the  period  of  such 
notice or, as the case may be, the time required for obtaining such consent or sanction shall be excluded. 

Explanation.—In computing the time required for obtaining the consent or sanction of the Government or 
any other authority, the date on which the application was made for obtaining the consent or sanction and the 
date of receipt of the order of the Government or other authority shall both be excluded. 

(4) In computing the period of limitation, the time during which the offender— 

(a) has been absent from India or from any territory outside India which is under the administration of 

the Central Government, or

run at every moment of the time during which the offence continues. 

473.  Extension  of  period  of  limitation  in  certain  cases.—Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  the 
foregoing  provisions  of  this  Chapter,  any  Court  may  take  cognizance  of  an  offence  after  the  expiry  of  the 
period of limitation, if it is satisfied on the facts and in the circumstances of the case that the delay has been 
properly explained or that it is necessary so to do in the interests of justice.
